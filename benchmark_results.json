The median PFS was 4.7 months (95% CI = 4.3-5.3) in the TA6/TA6 group, 5.0 months (95% CI = 4.1-6.2) in the TA6/TA7 group, 5.3 months (95% CI = 2.8-NA) in the TA7/TA7 group, 4.8 months (95% CI = 4.1-5.5) in the GG group, 4.9 months (95% CI = 4.4-5.3) in the GA group, and 4.4 months (95% CI = 3.9-NA) in the AA group (Figure 1A, B). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.7 months in all patients. And the median OS was 9.5 months (95% CI = 8.8-10.2) in the TA6/TA6 group, 9.0 months (95% CI = 8.3-NA) in the TA6/TA7 group, 11.2 months (95% CI = 9.1-NA) in the TA7/TA7 group, 9.3 months (95% CI = 8.8-10.9) in the GG group, 9.3 months (95% CI = 8.7-NA) in the GA group, and NA (95% CI = 8.8-NA) in the AA group, respectively (Figure 1).\u201d",

                "By using this approach, we assessed the catalytic activities of wild-type CYP3A4 and 22 allelic variants with substrate ticagrelor. Michaelis\u2013Menten plots for each CYP3A4 variant were shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding kinetic parameters were summarized in Table 3. CYP3A4*30 (R130STOP) could not be determined because of no detectable enzymatic activity toward ticagrelor. Except for CYP3A4*30, the Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics of other 21 CYP3A4 variants could be determined. The estimated kinetic parameters Vmax, Km and CLint for AR-C124910XX of CYP3A4*1 were 1743.33 pmol/min/nmol, 2.18 \u00b5M and 800.45 \u00b5L/min/nmol, respectively. Almost of the variants exhibited changed Vmax or Km values compared with that of CYP3A4*1, which results in significant variations in CLint.",
                "Except for CYP3A4*30, the remaining 21 CYP3A4 variants could be classified into the following three categories according to the relative clearance values compare with CYP3A4*1: CYP3A4*11, CYP3A4*18 and CYP3A4*33 showed significantly higher intrinsic clearance than that of CYP3A4*1; four CYP3A4 variants (CYP3A4*10, CYP3A4*23, CYP3A4*32 and CYP3A4*34) were not significantly different from that of wild-type; the remaining fourteen variants (CYP3A4*2-*5, *9, *14-*17, *19, *24, *28, *29, and *31,) exhibited significantly reduced CLint in different degrees (1.48%\u201375.11% relative clearance) compared to that of wild-type.",
                "In this study, insect cells were used to express 22 CYP3A4 variants, which were then incubated with 1\u201350 \u00b5M ticagrelor at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes to obtain the metabolite (AR-C124910XX).

                "In the five children with OXC-induced hypersensitivity, one of the two patients with OXC-SJS was positive for rs1061235T, but not HLA-A*31:01. None of the three children with OXC-MPE carried HLA-A*31:01 or rs1061235T. Even though the number of cases is too small to draw any conclusions, we thus did not observe any evidence indicating a strong association of HLA-A*31:01 with OXC hypersensitivity. Similarly, no carriers of HLA-B*15:02 were observed among the patients with OXC hypersensitivity. However, this was not unexpected, as none of the patients with OXC hypersensitivity reported Asian ancestry."

Haplotype mapping within patients with allelic markers of the 57.1 ancestral haplotype suggests a susceptibility locus within the 14-kb Hsp70 gene cluster.

Consistent with a role for both of these genetic markers in determining susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity, inclusion of the Hsp70-Hom M493T, in addition to the HLA-B*5701, allele provided significantly improved discrimination between abacavir-hypersensitive cases and -tolerant controls compared with the HLA-B*5701 allele alone (P = 0.003, Fisher's exact test).\u201d",
