      "summary": "## Background\nWarfarin dosing shows wide inter-individual variability. This study evaluated 250 Thai patients on stable warfarin to quantify how genetic variants and clinical factors influence maintenance dose. Genotypes assessed: VKORC1 −1639G>A (rs9923231), CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910), CYP4F2 rs2108622, and UGT1A1 rs887829.\n\n## Key Findings\n- VKORC1 −1639G>A (rs9923231): Strongest genetic predictor of lower dose. Compared with GG, GA and AA genotypes required 27.7% and 49.7% lower weekly doses, respectively (p<0.001). In multivariable modeling, GA and AA were associated with −9.7 mg and −18.1 mg/week, contributing 3.7% and 22.5% of dose variance.\n- CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910): Carriers required lower doses. Versus *1/*1, mean doses were 34.1% lower for *1/*3 and 64.6% lower for *3/*3 (univariate p=0.006); multivariable effects were −7.9 mg and −25.9 mg/week (both p<0.001), contributing 2.7% and 3.3% of variance.\n- CYP4F2 rs2108622: Modest effect toward higher dose. TT genotype increased dose by +4.1 mg/week vs CC (p=0.016), explaining 1.2% of variance. (Univariate differences were not significant.)\n- UGT1A1 rs887829: No association with dose (p=0.921).\n- Combined model (genetics + clinical factors) explained 51.3% of dose variability. Notable clinical effects included age (−0.25 mg/year; 10.8% variance) and BMI (+0.345 mg per kg/m2; 2.3%).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- In Thai patients, VKORC1 −1639G>A and CYP2C9*3 are key pharmacogenes for warfarin: carriers typically need substantially lower maintenance doses. CYP4F2 TT may justify a small upward adjustment; UGT1A1 rs887829 testing is not informative for warfarin dosing.\n- Incorporating VKORC1, CYP2C9*3, and CYP4F2 genotypes alongside age, BMI, and interacting drugs (e.g., amiodarone, antiplatelets) can materially improve initial dose selection and maintenance dose refinement, helping to reach therapeutic INR more safely and efficiently."
