From the methods section, I can see that rs9923231 corresponds to VKORC1 (-1639G > A).\n\nFrom the results section, I can extract the key findings:\n\n1. \"The patients with variant genotypes of VKORC1 \u2212 1639G > A required significantly lower warfarin stable weekly doses (SWDs) than those with wild-type genotype (p < 0.001).\"\n\n2. From Table 2, the specific genotype effects show:\n- AA genotype: 19.4 \u00b1 7.5 mg weekly dose\n- GA genotype: 27.9 \u00b1 9.0 mg weekly dose  \n- GG genotype: 38.6 \u00b1 8.0 mg weekly dose\n\n3. From Table 3, the multivariate analysis shows AA genotype was associated with 18.1 mg lower dose and GA genotype with 9.7 mg lower dose compared to GG genotype.\n\nThe population studied was Thai patients, and the comparison is against the wild-type GG genotype.\n\nGenotypes GA + AA are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in Thai patients as compared to genotype GG.",
