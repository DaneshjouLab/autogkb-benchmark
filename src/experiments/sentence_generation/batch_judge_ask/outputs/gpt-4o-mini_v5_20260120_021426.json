      "Genotypes AA + AG of rs9923231 are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as compared to genotype GG.  \nEXPLANATION: The study found that the AA and AG genotypes of rs9923231 were linked to lower warfarin dose requirements, contributing significantly to the variability in dosing (p < 0.01) among the 250 Thai patients analyzed."

      "Allele T of rs887829 is not associated with dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as compared to allele G.  \nEXPLANATION: The study concluded that the UGT1A1 rs887829 polymorphism did not significantly contribute to the variability in stable warfarin doses, indicating no association with dosing outcomes in the patient population."

      "Genotype TT of rs2108622 is associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as compared to genotype CC.  \nEXPLANATION: The analysis indicated that the TT genotype of rs2108622 accounted for a modest portion of the variability in warfarin dosing, with a contribution of approximately 1.2% to the overall dose variance among the studied patients."
