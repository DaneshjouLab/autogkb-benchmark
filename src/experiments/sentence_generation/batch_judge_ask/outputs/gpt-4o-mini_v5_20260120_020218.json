      "Genotypes AA + AG of rs9923231 are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as compared to genotype GG.  \nEXPLANATION: The study found that the AA and AG genotypes were linked to lower warfarin dose requirements, contributing significantly to the variability in dosing (p < 0.001) among the 250 Thai patients analyzed."

    "rs887829": [
      "Allele A of rs887829 is not associated with dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as compared to allele G.  \nEXPLANATION: The study concluded that the UGT1A1 rs887829 polymorphism did not significantly contribute to the variability in stable warfarin doses, indicating no association with dosing requirements in the studied population."

    "rs2108622": [
      "Genotype TT of rs2108622 is associated with increased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as compared to genotype CC.  \nEXPLANATION: The results indicated that the TT genotype of CYP4F2 rs2108622 accounted for a modest increase in warfarin dose variability, contributing approximately 1.2% to the overall dose variance in the cohort of 250 Thai patients."

    "rs1057910": [
      "Genotypes AC + CC of rs1057910 are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation, heart valve replacement, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as compared to genotype AA.  \nEXPLANATION: The study demonstrated that the presence of the AC and CC genotypes was linked to lower warfarin dose requirements, contributing to the overall variability in dosing among the Thai patient population analyzed."
