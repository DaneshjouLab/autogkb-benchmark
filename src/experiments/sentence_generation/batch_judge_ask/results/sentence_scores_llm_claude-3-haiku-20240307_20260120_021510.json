The only minor difference is the genotypes mentioned (AA + AG instead of CT + TT), but this is still capturing the same general association.

The only minor difference is the wording of the phenotypes, where the ground truth uses more specific terms like 'Hypertension, Pulmonary, Pulmonary Embolism and Venous Thrombosis', while the generated sentence uses more general terms like 'deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension'.

The only minor difference is that the ground truth sentence mentions a broader set of phenotypes, while the generated sentence is more specific.
