v3:
  name: "Batch dual format (rsID + genotype)"
  system: |
    You are a pharmacogenomics expert who summarizes genetic variant associations from scientific literature.

    You must generate sentences that precisely capture the pharmacogenetic relationship between variants and drug outcomes.
  user: |
    Based on the article below, generate a sentence describing the pharmacogenetic association for EACH of the following variants:

    {variants_list}

    CRITICAL: When describing variants, include BOTH formats when available:
    - The variant identifier (rsID like rs9923231, or star allele like CYP2D6*4, or HLA allele)
    - AND the specific genotype(s) mentioned in the article (e.g., "Genotypes CT + TT", "Allele T")

    SENTENCE FORMAT EXAMPLES:
    - "Genotypes CT + TT of rs9923231 are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation as compared to genotype CC."
    - "Genotypes AC + CC of rs1057910 are associated with decreased dose of warfarin as compared to genotype AA."
    - "CYP2D6 *4/*4 is associated with increased likelihood of adverse events when treated with risperidone as compared to CYP2D6 *1/*1."
    - "HLA-B *58:01 is associated with increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions when treated with allopurinol."
    - "Allele T of rs887829 is not associated with dose of warfarin as compared to allele C."
    - "Genotype TT of rs2108622 is associated with increased dose of warfarin as compared to genotype CC."

    KEY ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE:
    1. Genotype/Allele format FIRST (e.g., "Genotypes CT + TT", "Allele T", "Genotype TT")
    2. Variant identifier after genotype when it's an rsID (e.g., "of rs9923231")
    3. Association direction: "associated with" or "not associated with"
    4. Effect type: increased/decreased + likelihood/risk/severity/dose/concentrations
    5. Phenotype/outcome (e.g., adverse events, drug toxicity, treatment response, dose)
    6. Drug name
    7. Comparison group (e.g., "as compared to genotype CC", "as compared to allele G")

    IMPORTANT:
    - Start with the genotype format (Genotypes/Genotype/Allele), not the rsID
    - Look in the article for how genotypes are described (e.g., "CC", "CT", "TT" for SNPs)
    - For star alleles (CYP2D6*4) and HLA alleles (HLA-B*58:01), use them directly as the identifier

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    For each variant, output on a separate line:
    VARIANT: [variant_id]
    SENTENCE: [association sentence]

    Then a blank line before the next variant.

    Example:
    VARIANT: rs9923231
    SENTENCE: Genotypes CT + TT of rs9923231 are associated with decreased dose of warfarin as compared to genotype CC.

    VARIANT: rs1057910
    SENTENCE: Genotypes AC + CC of rs1057910 are associated with decreased dose of warfarin as compared to genotype AA.

    EXPLANATION REQUIREMENTS:
    - Cite the type of evidence (e.g., "study found...", "meta-analysis showed...", "p-value of...")
    - Mention sample size or population if available
    - Do NOT repeat the entire sentence - focus on the evidence

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    For each variant, output:
    VARIANT: [variant_id]
    SENTENCE: [association sentence]
    EXPLANATION: [brief evidence explanation]

    Then a blank line before the next variant.

    Example:
    VARIANT: rs9923231
    SENTENCE: Genotypes CT + TT of rs9923231 are associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with Atrial Fibrillation as compared to genotype CC.
    EXPLANATION: A study of 1,015 patients found that carriers of the T allele required significantly lower warfarin doses (p < 0.001) to achieve therapeutic INR levels.

    VARIANT: rs1057910
    SENTENCE: Genotypes AC + CC of rs1057910 are associated with decreased dose of warfarin as compared to genotype AA.
    EXPLANATION: The study demonstrated that AC and CC genotypes were associated with lower metabolic capacity and thus lower dose requirements.

    IMPORTANT:
    - Start sentences with the genotype format (Genotypes/Genotype/Allele), not the rsID
    - Look in the article for how genotypes are described (e.g., "CC", "CT", "TT" for SNPs)
    - For star alleles (CYP2D6*4) and HLA alleles (HLA-B*58:01), use them directly as the identifier
    - Always follow the exact format with VARIANT, SENTENCE, and EXPLANATION labels
