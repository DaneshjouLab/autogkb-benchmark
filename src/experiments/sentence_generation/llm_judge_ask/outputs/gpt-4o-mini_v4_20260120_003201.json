        "explanation": "A study involving 250 Thai patients demonstrated that the AA and GA genotypes of the VKORC1 \u2212 1639G > A polymorphism significantly contributed to higher warfarin dose requirements, accounting for 22.5% and 3.7% of the dose variance, respectively (p < 0.001)."

        "explanation": "The study involving 250 Thai patients found that the UGT1A1 rs887829 polymorphism did not significantly contribute to the variability in warfarin dose requirements, indicating no association with dose variability (p > 0.05)."

        "explanation": "The study found that the TT genotype of CYP4F2 rs2108622 accounted for a modest contribution of 1.2% to the variability in warfarin dose requirements among 250 Thai patients, indicating that this variant influences the necessary dosage for effective anticoagulation."
