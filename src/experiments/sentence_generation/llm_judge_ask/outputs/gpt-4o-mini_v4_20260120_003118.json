        "sentence": "Genotypes AA + GA of rs9923231 are associated with increased dose of warfarin in Thai patients as compared to genotype GG.",
        "explanation": "A study involving 250 Thai patients demonstrated that the AA genotype of rs9923231 accounted for a significant portion of the variability in warfarin dose requirements, with the AA genotype requiring higher doses to achieve therapeutic INR levels (p < 0.001)."

        "explanation": "The study involving 250 Thai patients found that the UGT1A1 rs887829 polymorphism did not significantly contribute to the variability in warfarin dose requirements, indicating no association with dose variability (p > 0.05)."

        "explanation": "The study found that the TT genotype of CYP4F2 rs2108622 accounted for a modest contribution of 1.2% to the variability in warfarin dose requirements among 250 Thai patients, indicating that this variant influences the necessary dosage for effective anticoagulation."

        "explanation": "The study involving 250 Thai patients demonstrated that the *CYP2C9*3* allele significantly contributed to warfarin dose variability, explaining about 6.0% of the variance, with the CC genotype requiring higher doses than the AA genotype (p < 0.05)."
