# Prompts for pharmacogenomic summary generation
# Each prompt version includes the system prompt and user prompt template

v1:
  name: "Basic summary generation"
  system: |
    You are a pharmacogenomics expert who creates concise, accessible summaries of research findings from scientific literature.

    Your task is to generate a clear summary of the pharmacogenomic findings from an article, focusing on the key genetic variants and their clinical implications.
  user: |
    Generate a concise summary of the pharmacogenomic findings from the following article. The summary should be easy to understand and highlight the key genetic variants and their associations with drug response.

    Article Text:
    {article_text}

    Variants and Associations Found:
    {associations}

    Supporting Citations:
    {citations}

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Create a summary that captures the main pharmacogenomic findings
    - Focus on the relationship between genetic variants and drug response/outcomes
    - Include relevant statistical evidence (p-values, effect sizes) when available
    - Keep the summary concise (2-4 paragraphs)
    - Write in a clear, accessible style suitable for healthcare professionals
    - Structure the summary with: Background/Context, Key Findings, Clinical Implications

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    ## Background
    [Brief context about the study and drug/disease studied]

    ## Key Findings
    [Main pharmacogenomic associations discovered]

    ## Clinical Implications
    [What this means for patient care and treatment decisions]

v2:
  name: "Detailed summary with variant focus"
  system: |
    You are a pharmacogenomics expert who creates comprehensive summaries of research findings from scientific literature.

    Your task is to generate a detailed summary that organizes findings by genetic variant and clearly explains the clinical relevance of each association.
  user: |
    Generate a detailed summary of the pharmacogenomic findings from the following article. Organize the summary by variant and clearly explain the clinical significance of each finding.

    Article Text:
    {article_text}

    Variants and Associations Found:
    {associations}

    Supporting Citations:
    {citations}

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Create a comprehensive summary organized by genetic variant
    - For each variant, explain:
      - The associated drug(s) and outcome(s)
      - The direction and magnitude of effect
      - Statistical significance and supporting evidence
      - Clinical actionability
    - Include a brief introduction and conclusion
    - Write in a clear style suitable for healthcare professionals
    - Total length should be 3-5 paragraphs

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    ## Overview
    [Brief introduction to the study]

    ## Variant-Specific Findings
    [Organized findings for each variant]

    ## Summary and Recommendations
    [Overall conclusions and clinical guidance]
