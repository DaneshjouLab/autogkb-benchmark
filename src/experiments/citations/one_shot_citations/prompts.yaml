# Prompts for citation finding experiment
# Each prompt version includes the system prompt and user prompt template

v1:
  name: "Basic citation finding"
  system: |
    You are a pharmacogenomics expert who identifies supporting evidence for pharmacogenetic association claims from scientific literature.

    Your task is to find the most relevant sentences or tables from the article that support each proposed pharmacogenomic relationship.
  user: |
    From the following article text, find the top 3-5 sentences from the article that are most relevant to and support each proposed pharmacogenomic association sentence.

    Pharmacogenomic Associations:
    {associations}

    Article text:
    {article_text}

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - For each numbered association, identify 3-5 sentences that provide supporting evidence for that SPECIFIC claim
    - Note: The same variant may appear multiple times with different association sentences - find citations for each specific sentence
    - If a table provides the support warranting inclusion, return the table header (## Table X: ..., etc.) as your sentence
    - Make sure to include a sentence or table in your top responses if it has the p-value for the relationship
    - Output the exact sentences from the article text
    - Keep in mind that headings are text/numbers preceded by hash symbols (#) and should not be included in citations unless referencing a table
    - Only include content sentences

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    For each association (using the same number from the input), output:
    ASSOCIATION: [number]
    CITATIONS:
    1. [exact sentence from article]
    2. [exact sentence from article]
    3. [exact sentence from article]
    ...

    Then a blank line before the next association.

    Example:
    ASSOCIATION: 1
    CITATIONS:
    1. Patients with CT or TT genotypes required significantly lower warfarin doses compared to CC genotype carriers (p < 0.001).
    2. The mean warfarin dose was 3.2 mg/day for CT/TT carriers versus 5.1 mg/day for CC carriers.
    3. ## Table 2: Association between rs9923231 genotypes and warfarin maintenance dose

v2:
  name: "Citation finding with explanation context"
  system: |
    You are a pharmacogenomics expert who identifies supporting evidence for pharmacogenetic association claims from scientific literature.

    Your task is to find the most relevant sentences or tables from the article that support each proposed pharmacogenomic relationship.
  user: |
    From the following article text, find the top 3-5 sentences from the article that are most relevant to and support each proposed pharmacogenomic association sentence.

    Pharmacogenomic Associations (with explanations):
    {associations}

    Article text:
    {article_text}

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - For each numbered association, identify 3-5 sentences that provide supporting evidence for that SPECIFIC claim
    - Note: The same variant may appear multiple times with different association sentences - find citations for each specific sentence
    - Use the explanation context to understand what kind of evidence to look for
    - If a table provides the support warranting inclusion, return the table header (## Table X: ..., etc.) as your sentence
    - Make sure to include a sentence or table in your top responses if it has the p-value for the relationship
    - Output the exact sentences from the article text
    - Keep in mind that headings are text/numbers preceded by hash symbols (#) and should not be included in citations unless referencing a table
    - Only include content sentences
    - Prioritize sentences with statistical evidence (p-values, effect sizes, sample sizes)

    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    For each association (using the same number from the input), output:
    ASSOCIATION: [number]
    CITATIONS:
    1. [exact sentence from article]
    2. [exact sentence from article]
    3. [exact sentence from article]
    ...

    Then a blank line before the next association.

    Example:
    ASSOCIATION: 1
    CITATIONS:
    1. Patients with CT or TT genotypes required significantly lower warfarin doses compared to CC genotype carriers (p < 0.001).
    2. The mean warfarin dose was 3.2 mg/day for CT/TT carriers versus 5.1 mg/day for CC carriers.
    3. ## Table 2: Association between rs9923231 genotypes and warfarin maintenance dose
    4. A total of 1,015 patients were genotyped for rs9923231, with 245 carrying the CT genotype and 89 carrying TT.
