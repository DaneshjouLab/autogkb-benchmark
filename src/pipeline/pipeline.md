# Pipeline
For this package we should be linking together the results from the different experiments to generate one cohesive output per pmcid
that includes found variants, association sentences, and citations. This output should not store the judging results, just the findings generated by each module.

We should be able to control prompts and model choices via a config file and these should also be included in the final output for reproducibility.

Follow conventions established in the experiments we've already done. We shouldn't be reinventing the wheel, let's use the highest performing models and prompts we have from our experiments.
