Due to its narrow therapeutic index and the large inter-individual variation of warfarin response, dosing may result in serious complications associated with bleeding or thromboembolism [[2](#CR2)]. Several genetic and non-genetic factors, e.g., age and body mass index, have been reported to be associated with warfarin dose requirements [[3](#CR3)]. Genetic polymorphisms are involved in both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin and, therefore, appear to play an important role in the inter-individual variability of warfarin doses [[4](#CR4)]. Two important genes have been identified as being responsible for warfarin treatment, including *cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9)* and the *vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1* (*VKORC1*) [[5](#CR5)]. *CYP2C9* gene encodes the CYP2C9 enzyme, which is the main metabolizing enzyme of *S*-warfarin. The *CYP2C9*2* and *CYP2C9*3* variants have been shown to have decreased enzymatic activity, which partly accounts for the variance in warfarin dose requirements [[5](#CR5)]. Previous studies in several different ethnic groups, including Thai, have shown that patients with the *CYP2C9*2* or *CYP2C9*3* allele required lower warfarin doses than those patients with the *CYP2C9*1* allele [[6](#CR6)–[8](#CR8)]. The *VKORC1* gene encodes the VKORC1 enzyme, which is the target enzyme of warfarin action. As reported in several of these ethnic groups, the promoter polymorphism in *VKORC1*-1639G > A, which is, in turn, associated with reduced VKORC1 messenger ribonucleic acid expression, results in the requirement for a lower warfarin dose [[7](#CR7), [9](#CR9), [10](#CR10)]. The previous studies in several different ethnic groups including Thai populations have reported that patients with single or double variant alleles of *VKORC1*-1639G > A or/and VKORC1 1173C > T required significantly lower warfarin doses compared to patients carrying the wild-type allele [[4](#CR4), [8](#CR8), [11](#CR11)–[13](#CR13)].\n\nA previous study reported that CYP4F2, a vitamin K oxidase enzyme, was involved in the metabolism of vitamin K to hydroxyvitamin K [[14](#CR14)]. The carriers of the *CYP4F2* rs2108622 variant allele may have a reduced capacity to metabolize vitamin K and, therefore, require a higher warfarin dose to obtain the same anticoagulant response [[15](#CR15)]. The previous studies suggest that *CYP4F2* rs2108622 plays a minor role in warfarin dosage requirement in Caucasians and Asians but not African Americans [[3](#CR3), [16](#CR16), [17](#CR17)]. In comparison with *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1*, there are a limited number of studies that investigated the effect of *CYP4F2* polymorphism on the warfarin dose requirement in Asians. Recently, the polymorphisms of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (*UGT1A1)* rs8175347 and rs887829, which are in linked disequilibrium, were significantly associated with a requirement for higher warfarin doses in Korean and Brazilian patients [[18](#CR18), [19](#CR19)]. The carriers of homozygous *UGT1A1* rs8175347 and rs887829 variant alleles are classified as poor metabolizers [[20](#CR20)]. Also, 7-hydroxywarfarin, the major metabolite of warfarin, is conjugated by UGT1A1, which is the phase II drug metabolizing enzyme of warfarin [[21](#CR21)]. Therefore, variations in UGT1A1 activity may change the levels of 7-hydroxywarfarin. This previous study has reported that 7-hydroxywarfarin acts as the competitive inhibitor of recombinant CYP2C9 metabolism of *S*-warfarin [[22](#CR22)]. Therefore, variations in 7-hydroxywarfarin levels may affect the metabolism of *S*-warfarin. There are few reported data on the association between *UGT1A1* polymorphisms and warfarin doses among multi-ethnic patient populations. Therefore, further study is required to elucidate the impact of *UGT1A1* polymorphisms on warfarin dose requirements in different ethnic groups.\n\nTaken together, non-genetic factors and two main genetic factors, *VKORC1* and *CYP2C9*, only explain approximately 57–58% of the variability in warfarin dosage. Age, weight, height, smoking and interacting medications accounted for less than 20% of the variance [[3](#CR3)]. More than 40% of the variance in the warfarin dose requirement remains unaccounted for. Therefore, further studies on additional factors contributing to the unexplained variation are required. Although many studies have investigated the genetic polymorphisms of *CYP2C9*3* and *VKORC1* on the warfarin dose requirements, only a few studies simultaneously characterized the effects of all drug metabolizing enzymes in the warfarin metabolic pathway and non-genetic factors in the same cohort study. Thus, the objective of this study was carried out to determine whether non-genetic and genetic factors of relevant drug metabolizing enzymes were involved in warfarin metabolism (*CYP2C9*3* and *UGT1A1* rs887829), site of action (*VKORC1*-1639G > A), and vitamin K metabolism (*CYP4F2* rs2108622).\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Patients\n\nA total of 250 patients at The Queen Sirikit Heart Center of Northeast Thailand and Srinagarind Hospital of the Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University who had stable doses of warfarin, were retrospectively recruited from the outpatient clinic during 2015–2016. Indications for warfarin in these patients were atrial fibrillation, heart valve replacement, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The inclusion criteria of study subjects included: (1) Thai patients were at least 18 years of age; (2) the international normalized ratio (INR) target range was 2.0–3.0; (3) stable weekly doses (SWDs) of warfarin were defined as the constant dose taken at two consecutive clinical visits for at least 1 month within a target INR range of 2–3; (4) patients who had a measured INR that deviated from the target range by ≤0.2 INR units and that did not result in a change in stable warfarin doses were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria included: (1) pregnant patients; (2) patients who had laboratory tests showing abnormal liver function tests (AST, ALT ≥3fold the upper limit of normal); (3) patients suffering from thyroid disorders. The study was approved by The Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee for Human Research ([HE581068](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/HE581068)). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.\n\n### Data collection\n\nThe medical records were reviewed. Demographic variables, i.e., gender, age, height, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) and clinical variables, i.e., indications for warfarin, SWDs of warfarin, INR values, concomitant medications, concomitant diseases, alcohol drinking, and smoking status were recorded. Current age was age at the last monitoring point while other covariates such as height, body weight, BMI, comorbidity, and concurrent medications were noted from the stable warfarin dose period.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nGenomic DNAs of study patients were extracted from peripheral blood using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Genotyping of *VKORC1* (−1639G > A; rs9923231; assay ID C_30403261_20), *CYP2C9*3* (1075A > C; rs1057910; assay ID: C_27104892_10), *CYP4F2* (1347C > T; rs2108622; assay ID C_16179493_40), and *UGT1A1* (rs887829; assay ID C_2669357_10) was performed by the Taqman allelic discrimination assay using a 7500HT Applied Biosystems thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nDeviations from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were tested using a chi-square goodness-of-fit analysis. A *p* value of less than 0.01 was assumed to indicate a deviation from HWE. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to compare the association of non-genetic factors, e.g., demographic and clinical variables and genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of interest with stable warfarin doses. Associations between stable warfarin doses and age, weight, height, BMI, and mean INR were evaluated using the Spearman’s correlation. The Mann-Whitney *U* test was used to compare the mean values of warfarin SWDs between two groups. The Kruskal-Wallis *H* test was used to determine associations between the mean values of warfarin SWDs of the three different genotype groups.\n\nMultiple linear regression analysis was used to investigate the factors that independently affected the inter-individual variability of warfarin dose requirements. The variables from univariate analysis with *p* < 0.05 were entered into the multiple linear regression model. In addition, the variables from univariate analyses with *p* > 0.05 (e.g., current smoking status and *CYP4F2* rs2108622 genotype) were entered into the multiple linear regression model. Stepwise selections of variables were entered into the regression method including non-genetic and genetic variables that met the default criteria of *p* < 0.05 for entry and *p* > 0.1 for removal. A 5% two-tailed significance level was used in all tests, and the *p* value of <0.05 was considered significantly different. The relative contributions of non-genetic and genetic factors to the total variability of warfarin dose demands were estimated according to the cumulative square of the correlation coefficient (*R* ^2^). The final *R* ^2^ of the model indicates the joint contribution of all variables to the variability in therapeutic warfarin dose requirements. The contribution of each factor was calculated as the difference of consecutive cumulative *R* ^2^ of each variable. All analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\n## Results\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of 250 patients (129 men and 121 women) are summarized in Supplementary Table [1](#MOESM1). The average age of these patients was 60.7 ± 12.8 years (range 22.0–87.0 years). BMI values varied between 14.7 and 43.3 kg/m^2^; the average BMI was 24.2 kg/m^2^. The average of warfarin SWDs was 22.3 ± 9.2 mg. The average INR of all patients was 2.42 ± 0.28. The most common indication for warfarin therapy was atrial fibrillation (67.2%). Over 45% of the study subjects had co-morbid chronic diseases including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and congestive heart failure. From univariate analysis, age, BMI, amiodarone use, antiplatelet drug use, e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, atrial fibrillation, and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism/chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension were found to be significantly associated with SWDs of warfarin (*p* < 0.05) (Supplementary Table [1](#MOESM1)). Gender had no significant effect on SWDs of warfarin (*p* = 0.998) (Supplementary Table [1](#MOESM1)).\n\nThe patients were stratified into four age groups (Table [1](#Tab1)). The study results indicated that the patients older than 60 years required significantly lower warfarin SWDs as compared with those in the group of 20–39 years. In contrast, the patients in the group of 40–59 years did not significantly require higher warfarin SWDs than those in the group of 20–39 years (Table [1](#Tab1)). Patients’ INR values in the groups of 40–59, 60–79, and 80–99 years were not significantly different from those in the group of 20–39 years (data not shown). Based on the patients’ BMI, patients with class I and II obesity (30–39.9 kg/m^2^) required a significantly 24.9% higher SWDs of warfarin as compared with normal weight patients (Table [1](#Tab1)). In contrast, the averages of warfarin SWDs received in the patients who were underweight (< 18.5 kg/m^2^), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m^2^), and class III obesity (morbidly obese) (≥ 40 kg/m^2^) were not significantly different from normal weight patients (Table [1](#Tab1)).\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Age/BMI category | Age (years)/BMI (kg/m2) Mean ± SD (range) | Number (%) | Stable weekly dose (mg) Mean ± SD (range) | p value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 20–39 years | 32.1 ± 4.5 (22.0–38.0) | 15 (6.0) | 28.0 ± 12.4 (8.0–52.5) | - |\n| 40–59 years | 51.2 ± 5.5 (41.0–59.0) | 88 (35.2) | 24.6 ± 9.4 (6.0–55.0) | 0.193 |\n| 60–79 years | 67.9 ± 5.5 (60.0–79.0) | 133 (53.2) | 20.8 ± 8.3 (5.3–43.8) | 0.021* |\n| 80–99 years | 82.5 ± 2.6 (80.0–87.0) | 14 (5.6) | 15.0 ± 6.1 (10.5–28.0) | 0.005* |\n| Underweight | 17.3 ± 1.0 (14.7–18.4) | 26 (10.4) | 18.9 ± 9.2 (6.0–42.0) | 0.158 |\n| Normal weight | 22.4 ± 1.7 (18.5–24.9) | 131 (52.4) | 21.3 ± 8.7 (5.3–50.0) | - |\n| Overweight | 26.9 ± 1.4 (25.0–29.6) | 69 (27.6) | 23.7 ± 9.3 (6.0–55.0) | 0.077 |\n| Obese (class I & II) | 32.0 ± 1.9 (30.2–37.2) | 20 (8.0) | 26.6 ± 8.2 (13.5–45.0) | 0.008** |\n| Obese (class III) | 41.6 ± 1.4 (40.0–43.3) | 4 (1.6) | 30.5 ± 17.8 (10.5–52.5) | 0.266 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Characteristics of patients receiving warfarin according to the age or BMI categories\n\nThe non-parametric Spearman-rank correlation analysis of the data revealed that the stable weekly warfarin doses were significantly negatively correlated with age (*r* = −0.332; *p* < 0.001) consistent with the results of the above-mentioned analyses. In contrast, the stable weekly warfarin doses were significantly positively correlated with body weight (*r* = 0.239; *p* < 0.001), BMI (*r* = 0.224; *p* < 0.001). Height and mean INR had no significant correlations with the stable weekly warfarin doses (*r =* 0.111; *P* = 0.81 and *r* = −0.008; *p* = 0.905) (data not shown).\n\nFrequencies of the alleles and genotypes of polymorphisms for *VKORC1*, *CYP2C9*, *CYP4F2*, and *UGT1A1* genes are summarized in Table [2](#Tab2). According to the χ^2^ test for goodness of fit, these four SNPs including *VKORC1* − 1639G > A, *CYP2C9*3*, *CYP4F2* rs2108622, and *UGT1A1* rs887829 were in HWE at a *p* < 0.01 criterion (data not shown). The comparisons of warfarin SWDs among those patients with different genotypes are shown in Table [2](#Tab2). Patients with AA and GA genotypes of *VKORC1* − 1639G > A required 49.7% and 27.7% significantly lower averages of SWDS of warfarin as compared with those with wild-type GG genotype (*p* < 0.001). The averages of warfarin SWDs were 64.6% and 34.1% lower in *CYP2C9 *3/*3* and **1/*3* patients than in **1/*1* patients (*p* = 0.006). The dosage requirement differences, however, were not observed in patients with variant genotypes of *CYP4F2* rs2108622 and *UGT1A1* rs887829 (*p* = 0.172 and *p* = 0.921) (Table [2](#Tab2)).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Genotype/Allele | Number of patients (%) | Stable weekly dose (mg) Mean ± SD | p value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| VKORC1 -1639G > A |  |  |  |\n| Genotype |  |  |  |\n| GG | 7 (2.8) | 38.6 ± 8.0 | <0.001 |\n| GA | 70 (28.0) | 27.9 ± 9.0 |   |\n| AA | 173 (69.2) | 19.4 ± 7.5 |   |\n| Allele |  |  |  |\n| G | 84 (16.8) | - | - |\n| A | 416 (83.2) | - |   |\n| CYP2C9 |  |  |  |\n| Genotype |  |  |  |\n| *1/*1 | 239 (95.6) | 22.6 ± 9.2 | 0.006 |\n| *1/*3 | 10 (4.0) | 14.9 ± 5.3 |   |\n| *3/*3 | 1 (0.4) | 8.0 |   |\n| Allele |  |  |  |\n| *1 | 488 (97.6) | - | - |\n| *3 | 12 (2.4) | - |   |\n| CYP4F2 rs2108622 |  |  |  |\n| Genotype |  |  |  |\n| CC | 153 (61.2) | 22.2 ± 10.0 | 0.172 |\n| CT | 81 (32.4) | 21.8 ± 7.4 |   |\n| TT | 16 (6.4) | 25.8 ± 8.4 |   |\n| Allele |  |  |  |\n| C | 387 (77.4) | - | - |\n| T | 113 (22.6) | - |   |\n| UGT1A1 rs887829 |  |  |  |\n| Genotype |  |  |  |\n| CC | 192 (76.8) | 22.0 ± 9.1 | 0.921 |\n| CT | 56 (22.4) | 23.0 ± 9.6 |   |\n| TT | 2 (0.8) | 22.8 ± 17.3 |   |\n| Allele |  |  |  |\n| C | 440 (88.0) | - | - |\n| T | 60 (12.0) | - |   |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Differences in stable weekly doses of warfarin among genotypes\n\nA multiple linear regression model using the predictors including *VKORC1* − 1639G > A, *CYP2C9*3*, and *CYP4F2* rs2108622, age, BMI, antiplatelet drug use, amiodarone use, current smoking status explained 51.3% of individual differences in the stable warfarin doses (Table [3](#Tab3)). Increasing age, concomitant use of antiplatelet drugs, amiodarone use, variant genotypes of *CYP2C9*3*, and *VKORC1* − 1639G > A were negatively associated with warfarin dose requirements; while increased BMI, current smoker status, and the TT variant genotype of *CYP4F2* rs2108622 showed positive correlations. The warfarin SWDs were decreased by 9.7 mg and 18.1 mg in the patients with GA and AA genotypes of *VKORC1* − 1639G > A as compared with those with wild-type GG genotype (*p* < 0.001) (Table [3](#Tab3)). Similarly, the warfarin SWDs were decreased by 7.9 mg and 25.9 mg in the patients with *CYP2C9 *1/*3* and *CYP2C9 *3/*3* genotypes as compared with those with wild-type **1/*1* genotype (*p* < 0.001) (Table [3](#Tab3)). According to age, warfarin SWDs were decreased by 0.25 mg with each year of aging (*p* < 0.001) (Table [3](#Tab3)). For co-medications, warfarin SWDs were decreased by 7.2 mg and 3.4 mg in the patients receiving amiodarone and antiplatelet drugs together with warfarin (*p* < 0.001 and *p* = 0.021) (Table [3](#Tab3)), whereas, warfarin SWDs were increased by 0.3 mg for each 1-point increase in BMI. In addition, warfarin SWDs were increased by 4.1 mg in the patients with the TT variant genotype of *CYP4F2* rs2108622 as compared with those with the wild-type CC genotype (*p* = 0.016) (Table [3](#Tab3)). Similarly, warfarin SWDs were increased by 3.9 mg in current smokers as compared with non-current smokers (Table [3](#Tab3)).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n| Entry into model | Predictors | Unstandardized β Coefficients | Cumulative Model R 2 (%) | Contribution (%) | p value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Constant | 45.110 |   |   | < 0.001 |\n| 1 | VKORC1 (−1639G > A) AA genotype | −18.109 | 22.5 | 22.5 | < 0.001 |\n| 2 | Age (in years) | −0.250 | 33.3 | 10.8 | < 0.001 |\n| 3 | VKORC1 (−1639G > A) GA genotype | −9.745 | 37.0 | 3.7 | < 0.001 |\n| 4 | CYP2C9*3/*3 | −25.921 | 40.3 | 3.3 | < 0.001 |\n| 5 | Amiodarone use | −7.245 | 43.3 | 3.0 | < 0.001 |\n| 6 | CYP2C9*1/*3 | −7.919 | 46.0 | 2.7 | < 0.001 |\n| 7 | Body mass index | 0.345 | 48.3 | 2.3 | < 0.001 |\n| 8 | CYP4F2 rs2108622 TT genotype | 4.149 | 49.5 | 1.2 | 0.016 |\n| 9 | Antiplatelet drugs use | −3.359 | 50.5 | 1.0 | 0.021 |\n| 10 | Current smoker | 3.968 | 51.3 | 0.8 | 0.039 |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Multiple linear regression analyses for variables responsible for stable weekly warfarin doses\n\n## Discussion\n\nResults from the present study suggest that genetic factors, including *CYP2C9*3*, *CYP4F2* rs2108622, and *VKORC1* − 1639G > A genotypes and non-genetic factors with age, BMI, amiodarone use, antiplatelet drug use, and current smoking explained 51.3% of the variability in warfarin dose requirements. The present study is the first study to simultaneously evaluate the effects of genetic polymorphisms of all drug metabolizing enzymes that are responsible for warfarin metabolism (*CYP2C9* and *UGT1A1*), site of action (*VKORC1*), and vitamin K metabolism (*CYP4F2*) on warfarin dose requirements in Thai patients. Apart from *VKORC1* and *CYP2C9* genes, these results showed that the *CYP4F2* gene also contributed to warfarin dose requirements in Thais at a modest level, whereas *UGT1A1* did not contribute to warfarin dose variability.\n\nIn this study, it confirmed the previous findings that *VKORC1* − 1639G > A and *CYP2C9*3* were the major genetic determinants of warfarin dose requirements, with CYP4F2 having a smaller effect [[3](#CR3), [23](#CR23), [24](#CR24)]. This also confirmed the previous studies that at 26.2% of the warfarin dose variance (22.5% from *VKORC1* (−1639G > A) AA genotype and 3.7% from *VKORC1* (−1639G > A) GA genotype) (Table [3](#Tab3)) [[3](#CR3), [25](#CR25)], the *VKORC1* − 1639G > A polymorphism accounted for the largest portion. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the associations between multiple variables and stable weekly warfarin doses at one time by adjusting the confounding factors, e.g., age, BMI, antiplatelet drug use, amiodarone use, current smoking*, CYP2C9*3*, and *CYP4F2* rs2108622, which may affect the *VKORC1*-1639G > A effects on warfarin dose variance.\n\nThe contribution of *VKORC1*-1639G > A was greater than that of *CYP2C9*3*, which was similar to those previous reports [[6](#CR6)–[8](#CR8)]. The present study showed that the *CYP2C9*3* allele could explain about 6.0% of the warfarin dose variance (3.3% from *CYP2C9*3/*3* and 2.7% from *CYP2C9*1/*3*) (Table [3](#Tab3)). Similarly, as in the previous studies, the predictive contribution of *CYP2C9*3* varied from 1.7–5.4% in Asians [[7](#CR7), [26](#CR26)], which was lower when compared with Caucasian populations [[3](#CR3)]. A previous study in a Caucasian population reported that defective *CYP2C9* alleles explained 16.7% of the variability in warfarin dose (12.9% from *CYP2C9*3* and 3.8% from *CYP2C9*2*) [[3](#CR3)]. It is possible that no *CYP2C9*2* allelic variant and lower frequencies of the *CYP2C9*3* were found in Asians as compared with Caucasians [[27](#CR27)] which could explain the lower contribution of the *CYP2C9*3* allele in this study. For the *CYP4F2* rs2108622 polymorphism, the results revealed that the variant TT genotype was identified as a significant contributor and accounted for a modest part of warfarin dose variability (1.2%) (Table [3](#Tab3)). Similarly, the previous studies in Asians and Caucasians reported that the predictive contribution of *CYP4F2* rs2108622 varied from 1.4–4.0% [[3](#CR3), [23](#CR23), [24](#CR24)]. According to the *UGT1A1* rs887829 polymorphism, the present results showed that *UGT1A1* rs887829 did not significantly contribute to the variability of the stable warfarin doses (Table [2](#Tab2)) which was not consistent with the study of Korean patients [[18](#CR18)]. In this Thai study population, MAF of *UGT1A1* rs887829 SNP was similar to the Korean population (12% vs. 13.2%) [[18](#CR18)]. MAF of *UGT1A1* rs887829 SNP was, however, higher in Caucasians (31%) and African-Americans (43%) [[28](#CR28)]. Although the MAF of *UGT1A1* rs887829 in this study population is similar to Koreans, the effects of *UGT1A1* rs887829 on warfarin dose requirements between Thais and Koreans were different. The reason for these different results is still not well understood.\n\nIn terms of non-genetic factors, these results were similar to those previously reported in the literature [[3](#CR3), [7](#CR7), [29](#CR29)], namely age, BMI, current smoking status, and use of co-medications. In comparison to genetic factors, non-genetics factors played a less important role to explain the variability in warfarin dose requirements. Among non-genetic factors investigated, age accounted for the largest portion, 10.8% of the warfarin dose variance (Table [3](#Tab3)). Additionally, interacting co-medications including amiodarone and BMI explained 3% and 2.3% of the dose variance (Table [3](#Tab3)). Furthermore, antiplatelet drug use including clopidoglel, prasugrel, ticagrelor explained up to 1.0% of the dose variance. These interactions cause a possible increase in the anticoagulation effect of warfarin when combined with antiplatelet effects. Although both amiodarone and antiplatelet drug use, including clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, are considered as minor contributors; however, this knowledge may help the clinicians in adjusting the dose of warfarin for patients who receive long-term amiodarone or antiplatelet drug treatment. Current smoking, according to present results, was considered a minor contributor to guide warfarin dose adjustment. It is possible that smoking may potentially cause an interaction with warfarin by increasing warfarin clearance through the induction of CYP1A2, which leads to a reduced warfarin effect [[29](#CR29), [30](#CR30)].\n\nIn summary, results in this present study show that genetic and non-genetic factors are important in determining the variability in warfarin response. *VKORC1-1639G > A* and *CYP2C9*3* were the strongest genetic predictors of warfarin doses in Thai patients, with *CYP4F2* rs2108622 having a minor effect; with age, amiodarone use, and BMI being important clinical predictors. Therefore, a more accurate prediction of warfarin dose requirements needs to take into account both genetic and non-genetic factors. There were inherent limitations to the retrospective study design. Confounding factors could not be controlled, e.g., diet containing vitamin K. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether prediction of optimal warfarin doses are enhanced, and adverse effects are avoided by using genetic (*VKORC1*, *CYP2C9*, *CYP4F2)* and non-genetic factors, e.g., age, amiodarone use, BMI, antiplatelet use, and current smoking status to help guide the selection of a patient’s initial warfarin and maintenance doses.\n\n## Electronic supplementary material\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nGrants from the Thailand Research Fund (TRG5880001) and Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand (grant number IN59353) are acknowledged.

Therefore, relationships between EFV pharmacokinetics (PK) and key genetic polymorphisms with 96-week efficacy and safety were investigated.\n\n**Methods:** \nRelationships between EFV PK parameters and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; CYP2B6,CYP2A6, CYP3A4, NR1I3, NR1I2, ABCB1) with plasma HIV-RNA (pVL) <200 copies/mL and EFV discontinuation and adverse events at 96 weeks were explored. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis evaluated the predictability of mid-dose interval (C12) cutoffs and 96-week pVL.\n\n**Results:** \nA total of 606 patients (32 % female; 37 % African, 33 % Asian; n = 311 EFV400, n = 295 EFV600) were included. EFV PK parameters, including C12, were not associated with pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks (odds ratio [OR] 5.25, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.41–67.90, p = 0.204). Lower risk of CNS-related adverse events was associated with CYP2B6 983TC/CC (OR 0.35, 95 % CI 0.15–0.81, p = 0.015) and higher risk was associated with CYP2B6 15582CT/TT and ABCB1 3435TT (OR 1.46, 95 % CI 1.02–2.09, p = 0.040; OR 2.31, 95 % CI 1.33–4.02, p = 0.003, respectively). Discontinuation due to adverse events (clinician decision) was independently associated with dose (OR 2.54, 95 % CI 1.19–5.43, p = 0.016). C12 between 0.47 and 0.76 mg/L provided sensitivity/specificity >90 % (100 %/92.3 to 98.9 %/92.3 %) for achieving pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks.\n\n**Conclusions:** \nA higher rate of EFV-related adverse events and discontinuations due to these events for EFV600 were not driven by polymorphisms assessed. Although a single threshold concentration associated with HIV suppression may be clinically useful, it was not viable for ENCORE1. Implementation of EFV400 would improve toxicity management whilst still maintaining good efficacy.\n\n**Electronic supplementary material:** \nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s40262-015-0360-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\n### Background\n\nENCORE1 demonstrated non-inferiority of daily efavirenz 400 mg (EFV400) versus 600 mg (EFV600) to 96 weeks in treatment-naïve, HIV-infected adults but concerns regarding lower EFV400 concentrations remained.

Although a single threshold concentration associated with HIV suppression may be clinically useful, it was not viable for ENCORE1.

Achieving pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks was not associated with the selection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP3A4, NR1I3, NR1I2, ABCB1) assessed. |\n| --- |\n| EFV-related adverse events and discontinuations due to these events were increased with dose but the higher rate of EFV-related adverse events for EFV600 was not associated with the SNPs investigated. CNS adverse events were not driven by EFV dose or concentrations; however, CYP2B6 15582CT/TT and ABCB1 3435TT carriers were at higher risk (46 and 131 %, respectively) of CNS-related adverse events compared with 35 % lower risk in CYP2B6 983TC/CC patients. Possession of the CYP2B6 516GT and TT variants and CYP2A6*9B CA/AA carriers was associated with a higher risk of overall EFV discontinuation (80, 166 and 100 %, respectively), whereas NR1I2 63396TT carriers were at decreased risk (22 %). |\n| ENCORE1 questions the validity of the currently accepted minimum effective concentration (MEC) of 1.0 mg/L. The proportions of patients with pVL ≥200 copies/mL was not significantly different between those with model-predicted EFV C12 (mid-dosing interval concentration) above or below 1.0 mg/L (2 % [11/557] vs. 11 % [2/18], p = 0.059; note that 2/20 patients with C12 <1.0 mg/L had missing pVL at 96 weeks). Although a threshold concentration is clinically useful, the acceptable receiver operating characteristic criteria associated with a range of C12 cutoffs (0.47–0.76 mg/L) for pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks suggests a single target value is not statistically valid. |\n## Introduction\n\nAntiretroviral dose reduction is an ongoing area of debate, focusing on advantages of reduced adverse events and treatment costs versus the potential risk of higher rates of virological failure.\n\nEfavirenz (EFV; 600 mg once daily), the mainstay of combination antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings [[1](#CR1)], was selected as a potential candidate for dose reduction based on early clinical data that observed similar short-term efficacy with lower EFV doses (200 and 400 mg once daily [[2](#CR2)]). These data and the principle that successful antiretroviral dose reduction can cut medication costs and allow greater treatment coverage, was the impetus behind the design and implementation of the ENCORE1 trial. ENCORE1, a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, demonstrated non-inferiority of reduced-dose EFV (400 mg once daily; EFV400) with the standard dose (600 mg once daily; EFV600) in treatment-naïve, HIV-infected adults at 48 weeks [[3](#CR3)] and was sustained to 96 weeks [[4](#CR4)].\n\nImportant concerns regarding the impact of lower concentrations with EFV400 and overall influence of key genetic factors on pharmacokinetics (PK) were recently addressed for the 48-week outcome data [[5](#CR5)]. In this study, we present the final EFV PK-pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacogenetic cross-sectional analysis of ENCORE1 at 96 weeks.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Patients\n\nThe ENCORE1 study design (to 48 and 96 weeks) has been previously described in detail [[3](#CR3), [4](#CR4)]. ENCORE1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in treatment-naïve, HIV-infected individuals ≥16 years of age recruited from 38 study sites across Africa, Asia, South America, Europe and Oceania. Patients were randomised to EFV400 or EFV600 with tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada^®^, 300/200 mg) administered once daily. The study was granted ethical and regulatory approval and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\n### Sampling and Pharmacokinetics (PK)\n\nThe ENCORE1 PK sampling scheme has been previously reported [[5](#CR5)]. Random, single blood samples were collected at weeks 4 and 12 of therapy (between 8 and 16 h post-dose) and intensive sampling was also carried out in a subgroup of patients (*n* *=* 46) between weeks 4 and 8 (pre-dose [0 h], 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 h post-dose). EFV plasma concentrations were quantified by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) method [[6](#CR6)] and non-linear mixed effects modelling was applied to the data (NONMEM v. 7.2; ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA [[7](#CR7)]) to determine EFV PK parameters in each patient at each sampling occasion. The impact of patient demographics and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; see below) on EFV concentrations was evaluated as part of the modelling process [[5](#CR5)]. Derived PK parameters, including area under the concentration–time curve over the 24-h dosing interval (AUC_24_), maximum concentration (*C*_max_), trough concentration 24 h post-dose (C_24_) and concentration 12 h post-dose representing the mid-dose interval concentration (C_12_) were determined for each sampling occasion, and the mean for each patient was calculated. Standard modelling practices were applied, with the procedures recently being described in detail [[5](#CR5)].\n\n### Genotyping\n\nThe SNPs *CYP2B6* 516 G>T (rs3745274), *CYP2B6* 983 T>C (rs28399499), *CYP2B6* 15582C>T (rs4803419), *CYP2A6**9B (rs8192726), *CYP2A6**17 (rs28399454), *CYP3A4**22 (rs35599367), *NR1I3* 540C>T (rs2307424) and *NR1I3* 1089T>C (rs3003596) were previously genotyped [[5](#CR5)]. Additionally, *ABCB1* 3435C>T (rs1045642), *NR1I2* 63396C>T (rs2472677) and *NR1I2* 7635A>G (rs6785049) were genotyped using real-time PCR allelic discrimination assays for the present analysis (C_7586657_20, C26079845_10 and C_29280426_10, respectively; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), as previously described [[8](#CR8), [9](#CR9)].\n\n### Pharmacokinetic–Pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) Analysis: Relationships with Virological and Safety Endpoints\n\nThe primary PD endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HIV RNA (pVL) <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks by randomised dose (Fisher’s exact test). Patients without a viral load measurement at 96 weeks were excluded from the analysis. Relationships between pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks and log-transformed model-predicted EFV AUC_24_, *C*_max_, C_24_, and C_12_ were performed by logistic regression.\n\nSafety endpoints consisted of EFV discontinuation and adverse events. Overall discontinuation was defined as interruption in EFV treatment for more than 30 days. Adverse events were categorised as EFV-related defined in the Stocrin^®^ product information [[10](#CR10)], and EFV-related according to clinician decision. Additionally, CNS adverse events (as a subset of adverse events) defined in the Stocrin^®^ product information (including abnormal dreams, anxiety, dizziness, headache, impaired concentration, insomnia and somnolence [[10](#CR10)]) and treatment cessation due to EFV-related adverse events (clinician decision) were also assessed.\n\nDifferences in proportions of each safety endpoint by EFV dose were assessed using Pearson’s Chi-square test. Geometric mean ratio (GMR; 90 % confidence interval [CI]) was calculated to compare PK parameters between those who did or did not stop therapy and/or experience adverse events. Differences were considered significant if the CI did not cross 1.\n\n### Pharmacogenetics: Relationships with Virological and Safety Endpoints\n\nDifferences in proportions of pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks for each genetic polymorphism and pVL ≥200 copies/mL at week 96 stratified for metaboliser status (extensive, intermediate, slow; based on *CYP2B6* 516G>T/986T>C/*CYP2A6**9B/*17 composite genotype as previously reported [[5](#CR5)]) and dose were assessed using Fisher’s exact test.\n\nEvaluation of relationships between overall discontinuation with SNPs and EFV-related adverse events (Stocrin^®^ product information) and dose and SNPs was performed using Cox regression adjusted a priori for potential confounders (e.g. age, sex). Post hoc exploratory analysis of the crude association of dose and SNPs with CNS-related adverse effects, EFV-related adverse events (clinician decision) and treatment cessation due to EFV-related adverse event (clinician decision) was undertaken using logistic regression or Cox regression as appropriate.\n\n### Evaluation of the Recommended Minimum Effective Concentration (MEC, 1.0 mg/L)\n\nDifferences in the proportions of patients with model-predicted EFV C_12_ below and above the recommended minimum effect concentration (MEC) of 1.0 mg/L [[11](#CR11)] stratified by pVL (<200 copies/mL vs. ≥200 copies/mL) was determined using Fisher’s exact test. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was also performed to investigate the predictability of mid-dose interval concentration (C_12_) cutoffs and achieving pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks. Patients with pVL missing at 96 weeks were excluded from the analysis.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).\n\n## Results\n\n### Patients and PK\n\nOverall, 630 patients received at least one dose of EFV as part of ENCORE1 [[4](#CR4)]; 606 (32 % female) were included in the previously described population PK model [[5](#CR5)] and the present analyses (Fig. [1](#Fig1)a). Median (range) age, weight, baseline (week 0) pVL and CD4 cell count were 35 years (18–69), 65 kg (39–148), 56,803 copies/mL (162–10,000,000) and 270 cells/mm^3^, respectively. Patients identified themselves as African (37 %), Asian (33 %), Hispanic (17 %), Caucasian (13 %) and Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander (ATSI; 0.2 %), and 51 % and 49 % were randomised to EFV400 (*n* *=* 311) and EFV600 (*n* *=* 295), respectively.\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bbf/4916189/55b4489ed22c/40262_2015_360_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4916189_40262_2015_360_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nFlow diagram summarising a the data included in the population pharmacokinetic model and b genetic data available for analysis.

Upon assessment in the model as covariates they were found not to have a significant impact on EFV apparent oral clearance (CL/F). Therefore, the PK parameters did not alter from the previous 48-week analysis and were carried forward to the 96-week analysis. The final model included baseline weight and *CYP2B6* 516G>T/983T>C/*CYP2A6**9B/*17 composite genotype as significant covariates [[5](#CR5)]. Predicted EFV PK parameters stratified by dose and by dose and metaboliser status (extensive, intermediate, slow; based on *CYP2B6* 516G>T/983T>C/*CYP2A6**9B/*17 composite genotype), as presented for the 48-week analysis, are summarised (Online Resource 1 and 2, respectively).\n\n### Genotyping\n\nGenotyping was possible in 595 patients, and of the 606 patients included in the analysis, 32 did not have a genotyping sample (Fig. [1](#Fig1)b). Amplification failed in three patients for *NR1I2* 63396C>T and *NR1I2* 7635A>G. Depending on the SNP, PK and genetic data were available for between 570 and 574 patients (Fig. [1](#Fig1)b). Genotype frequencies summarised by ethnicity are shown in Table [1](#Tab1) (Caucasian, Hispanic and ATSI were combined for consistency with the 48-week analysis [[5](#CR5)]); all were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, with the exception of *NR1I2* 7635A>G; however, this was rectified when stratified by ethnicity.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| SNP | Number of patients [n (%)] |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Caucasian (n = 179)a | Asian (n = 201) | African (n = 226) |  |\n| CYP2B6 516G>T |  |  |  |\n| GG | 88 (49.2) | 80 (39.8) | 85 (37.6) |\n| GT | 68 (38.0) | 97 (48.3) | 97 (42.9) |\n| TT | 10 (5.6) | 18 (9.0) | 31 (13.7) |\n| Missing | 13 (7.3) | 6 (3.0) | 13 (5.8) |\n| CYP2B6 983T>C |  |  |  |\n| TT | 164 (91.6) | 195 (97.0) | 176 (77.9) |\n| TC | 2 (1.1) | 0 (0.0) | 34 (15.0) |\n| CC | 0 (0.0) | 0 (0.0) | 3 (1.3) |\n| Missing | 13 (7.3) | 6 (3.0) | 13 (5.8) |\n| CYP2B6 15582C>T |  |  |  |\n| CC | 68 (38.0) | 80 (39.8) | 172 (76.0) |\n| CT | 82 (45.8) | 101 (50.2) | 39 (15.0) |\n| TT | 16 (8.9) | 13 (6.5) | 2 (0.9) |\n| Missing | 13 (7.3) | 7 (3.5) | 13 (5.8) |\n| CYP2A6*9B |  |  |  |\n| CC | 148 (82.7) | 144 (71.6) | 174 (77.0) |\n| CA | 18 (10.1) | 37 (18.4) | 35 (15.5) |\n| AA | 0 (0.0) | 11 (5.5) | 3 (1.3) |\n| Missing | 13 (7.3) | 9 (4.5) | 14 (6.2) |\n| CYP2A6*17 |  |  |  |\n| CC | 158 (88.3) | 184 (91.5) | 172 (76.1) |\n| CT | 8 (4.5) | 9 (4.5) | 38 (16.8) |\n| TT | 0 (0.0) | 0 (0.0) | 3 (1.3) |\n| Missing | 13 (7.3) | 8 (4.0) | 13 (5.8) |\n| CYP3A4*22 |  |  |  |\n| GG | 64 (35.8) | 42 (20.9) | 179 (79.2) |\n| GA | 75 (41.9) | 96 (47.8) | 34 (15.0) |\n| AA | 27 (15.0) | 57 (28.4) | 0 (0.0) |\n| Missing | 13 (7.3) | 6 (3.0) | 13 (5.8) |\n| NR1I3 540C>T |  |  |  |\n| CC | 58 (32.4) | 40 (20.0) | 55 (24.3) |\n| CT | 81 (45.1) | 90 (44.8) | 106 (46.9) |\n| TT | 27 (15.1) | 65 (32.3) | 52 (23.0) |\n| Missing | 13 (7.3) | 6 (3.0) | 13 (5.8) |\n| NR1I3 1089T>C |  |  |  |\n| TT | 149 (83.2) | 186 (92.5) | 210 (92.9) |\n| TC | 17 (9.5) | 8 (4.0) | 3 (1.3) |\n| CC | 0 (0.0) | 0 (0.0) | 0 (0.0) |\n| Missing | 13 (7.3) | 7 (3.5) | 13 (5.8) |\n| ABCB1 3435C>T |  |  |  |\n| CC | 40 (22.3) | 52 (25.9) | 167 (73.9) |\n| CT | 89 (49.7) | 104 (51.7) | 45 (19.9) |\n| TT | 37 (20.7) | 39 (19.4) | 1 (0.4) |\n| Missing | 13 (7.3) | 6 (3.0) | 13 (5.8) |\n| NR1I2 63396C>T |  |  |  |\n| CC | 39 (21.9) | 23 (11.4) | 87 (38.5) |\n| CT | 81 (45.3) | 105 (52.2) | 107 (47.3) |\n| TT | 45 (25.1) | 65 (32.3) | 19 (8.4) |\n| Missing | 14 (7.8) | 8 (4.0) | 13 (5.8) |\n| NR1I2 7635A>G |  |  |  |\n| AA | 45 (25.1) | 84 (41.8) | 182 (80.5) |\n| AG | 75 (41.9) | 92 (45.8) | 27 (11.9) |\n| GG | 46 (25.7) | 18 (9.0) | 2 (0.9) |\n| Missing | 13 (7.3) | 7 (3.5) | 15 (6.6) |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Genotype frequencies stratified by ethnicity in patients included in the ENCORE1 96-week pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetic analysis (n = 606)\n\n### PK–PD Analysis: Relationships with Virological and Safety Endpoints\n\nAt 96 weeks, 97 and 99 % of patients were <200 copies/mL for EFV400 and EFV600, respectively (*p* *=* 0.091; 98 % pVL <200 copies/mL overall); 2 % (*n* *=* 13) had a detectable pVL ≥200 copies/mL, and 5 % (*n* *=* 31) of pVL were unavailable.\n\nFollowing univariable logistic regression, no relationships were observed between achieving pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks and log-transformed EFV PK parameters (logAUC_24_ odds ratio [OR] 4.20, 95 % CI 0.31–57.77, *p* *=* 0.283; log*C*_max_ OR 1.87, 95 % CI 0.11–32.50, *p* *=* 0.667; logC_24_ OR 4.17, 95 % CI 0.70–24.94, *p* *=* 0.118; and logC_12_ OR 5.25, 95 % CI 0.41–67.90, *p* *=* 0.204).\n\nEleven percent (*n* *=* 34) and 13 % (*n* *=* 39) of patients discontinued EFV400 and EFV600, respectively (*p* *=* 0.395; 73/606 [12 %]), and amongst those who discontinued, median (range) time to discontinuation was 36 weeks (2–90).

Fourteen and six patients had predicted C_12_ below the recommended MEC for EFV400 and EFV600, respectively, but only one patient in each randomised arm was not suppressed below 200 copies/mL at 96 weeks. In these two patients, EFV C_12_ and metaboliser status were 0.77 mg/L and extensive metaboliser (EFV400), and 0.38 mg/L and intermediate metaboliser (EFV600; two viral load measurements were unavailable) [Online Resource 3]. The ranges of predicted C_12_ stratified by metaboliser status of the ten (EFV400) and three patients (EFV600) with pVL ≥200 copies/mL at 96 weeks (*n* *=* 13 total) were 0.77–3.65 mg/L (extensive, *n* *=* 3), 1.45–3.38 mg/L (intermediate, *n* *=* 5), 3.0 mg/L and 6.10 mg/L (slow, *n* *=* 2) for EFV400; and 2.19 mg/L (extensive, *n* *=* 1), 0.38 mg/L and 3.02 mg/L (intermediate, *n* *=* 2) for EFV600.\n\nGenerally, the ROC curve lay along the line of unity between sensitivity and 1-specificity, suggesting the analysis was informative to an extent. The sensitivity/specificity of using C_12_ of 1.0 mg/L (currently recommended MEC) for achieving pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks was 97.1 %/84.6 %, with a likelihood ratio (LR) of 6. Acceptable ROC criteria were generated for a number of C_12_ values, suggesting a range of potential cutoffs; for example, C_12_ between 0.47 and 0.76 mg/L provided sensitivity/specificity >90 % (100 %/92.3 % to 98.9 %/92.3 %) with an LR of 13.\n\n## Discussion\n\nENCORE1 included a genetically and geographically diverse population of patients, thus providing an important dataset for thorough investigation of EFV PK–PD and pharmacogenetic relationships with clinical outcome and adverse events. EFV concentrations have previously been associated with virus suppression [[11](#CR11), [12](#CR12)]; however, this was not confirmed in ENCORE1. Relationships between model-derived PK parameters and achieving pVL <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks (cross-sectional assessment) were not significant. Although significant associations were observed with pVL <200 copies/mL at the 48-week cross-sectional analysis (but CIs were wide) [[5](#CR5)], both analyses should be interpreted cautiously, given only 16/593 (3 %) and 13/575 (2 %) patients had pVL ≥200 copies/mL at 48 and 96 weeks, respectively. Furthermore, the PK was performed between 4 and 12 weeks, and the association may have been lost for the more distal assessment at 96 weeks. Moreover, similar to the 48-week analysis [[5](#CR5)], none of the SNPs assessed showed a significant association with virological control at 96 weeks. This is in agreement with previous studies in which *CYP2B6* polymorphisms in particular did not predict virological failure in HIV patients with differential or self-reported poor adherence [[13](#CR13), [14](#CR14)]. Given the low proportion of failures in ENCORE1, the study lacked adequate power to fully evaluate the impact of selected SNPs on HIV suppression. However, a genome-wide association study conducted by Lehmann and colleagues was able to detect a genotypic relative risk of approximately 80 % power for polymorphisms with strong individual effects, but no associations with failure were observed even when adherence subgroups were considered [[14](#CR14)].\n\nPossession of homozygous wild-type *CYP2B6* 15582C>T/516G>T/983T>C (CC/GG/TT) is predictive of EFV C_24_ in the lowest concentration stratum [[15](#CR15)], and concerns have grown as to whether this population of individuals would be at increased risk of virological failure, particularly when receiving EFV400. This genotype was not predictive of failure in patients receiving the standard EFV dose [[14](#CR14)] and 47 ENCORE1 patients randomised to EFV400 with this genotype; only one had a detectable pVL ≥200 copies/mL at 96 weeks. Individual mean predicted EFV C_24_ was 2.79 mg/L in this patient and well above the median of 0.82 mg/L for this genotype group.\n\nA previously defined MEC of 1.0 mg/L is often quoted as a therapeutic cutoff for EFV mid-dosing interval concentrations [[11](#CR11), [12](#CR12)]; however, this value was obtained in an era of less potent antiretroviral therapy, with lamivudine, zidovudine, nelfinavir and amprenavir most commonly coadministered with EFV [[11](#CR11), [12](#CR12)]. The validity of a threshold concentration for virological failure has also been disputed due to low sensitivity of the predictive value, particularly in adherent patients [[16](#CR16)]. ENCORE1 provided an opportunity to investigate the plausibility of the widely implemented MEC. We chose to evaluate the threshold using the final 96-week pVL data rather than 48 weeks as this may be more representative of patients receiving long-term therapy. Assessment of the MEC was based on C_12_ (representing mid-dose interval concentrations) instead of C_24_ in order to remain consistent with the original publication by Marzolini et al [[11](#CR11)]. However, it is important to note that with only 2 % of patients with pVL ≥200 copies/mL at 96 weeks, a robust interrogation of the MEC is limited and care must be taken not to infer too much from the analysis. A range of C_12_ cutoffs (representing mid-dosing interval concentration) with acceptable sensitivity and specificity criteria were obtained by ROC analysis, suggesting a single threshold value is not statistically valid. Also, the proportion of patients with detectable viral load ≥200 copies/mL at 96 weeks was not significantly different between patients with predicted C_12_ below or above 1.0 mg/L with a similar lack of association for C_24_ (data not shown). However, this analysis should be interpreted cautiously given the limited failures and that PK data obtained following 4–12 weeks of therapy may not reflect concentrations at 96 weeks. Nonetheless, EFV concentrations below the currently accepted MEC had better sensitivity/specificity for achieving 96-week pVL <200 copies/mL, suggesting adherence is an important driver of virological suppression at 96 weeks in ENCORE1 patients. Self-reported adherence was documented at weeks 4, 48 and 96, and was >90 % in both treatment arms, which is generally consistent with findings observing optimal treatment response with adherence ≥95 % by pill count [[17](#CR17)]. Unfortunately, the adherence data collected as part of ENCORE1 were not sensitive enough to determine impact on clinical outcome.\n\nRates of overall discontinuation increased from 7 % at 48 weeks [[5](#CR5)] to 12 % at 96 weeks, but were similar for both EFV doses and comparable with previous reports [[10](#CR10), [18](#CR18), [19](#CR19)]. EFV concentrations influenced by metabolic and nuclear receptor polymorphisms but not dose were significantly associated with discontinuation. In contrast to the 48-week analysis, carriers of both *CYP2B6* 516GT or TT variants were at increased risk due to higher EFV concentrations, along with *CYP2A6**9B CA/AA. For the 48-week analysis, *CYP2B6* 516GT was not associated with discontinuation [[5](#CR5)]; however, at 96 weeks, discontinuations had increased, potentially altering the statistical association. Possession of *NR1I2* 63396TT lowered the risk of discontinuation by 22 % but was not assessed at 48 weeks, and inclusion in the multivariable model at 96 weeks may also speak to the disparity in relationships observed with overall discontinuation at 48 and 96 weeks. Pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) regulates basal CYP3A4 expression, and *NR1I2* 63396C>T has been linked to altered expression of PXR and activity of CYP3A4 [[20](#CR20)]. Homozygosity for the *NR1I2* 63396C>T variant has been associated with increased oral clearance and subtherapeutic trough concentrations of unboosted atazanavir [[21](#CR21), [22](#CR22)], and although CYP3A4 is a minor route of EFV metabolism, decreased risk of discontinuation in *NR1I2* 63396TT patients may be a consequence of lower concentrations resulting from increased metabolism.\n\nCNS adverse events at 96 weeks (as outlined in the Stocrin^®^ product information) were not associated with EFV dose or plasma concentrations. The primary metabolite produced by CYP2B6 metabolism, 8-hydroxy-efavirenz (8OH-EFV) [[23](#CR23)], has been identified in vitro as a contributing factor to toxicity in rat neuronal cultures [[24](#CR24)], and potentially 8OH-EFV, rather than the parent compound, is a causative agent of CNS adverse events. Indeed, in ENCORE1 patients a lower risk of CNS adverse events at 96 weeks (and similarly at 48 weeks [[5](#CR5)]) was observed in *CYP2B6* 983TC/CC carriers, in which CYP2B6 metabolism is impeded, generating less 8OH-EFV and thus providing a protective effect. Conversely, *ABCB1* 3435TT markedly increased the risk of experiencing CNS adverse events by 131 % compared with wild-type (CC). This is in general consensus with a previous AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) study that reported a relationship between *ABCB1* 3435TT (with *ABCB1* 2677G>T) and failure of EFV-containing regimens due to toxicity [[25](#CR25)]. *ABCB1* encodes the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which is present at various physiological sites, including the blood–brain barrier [[26](#CR26), [27](#CR27)], where it limits entry of compounds, including drugs, into the CNS. Furthermore, *ABCB1* 3435TT has been associated with decreased P-glycoprotein expression [[28](#CR28)]. EFV is not transported by P-glycoprotein [[29](#CR29), [30](#CR30)], but it is currently unknown whether EFV metabolites, such as 8OH-EFV, are substrates. We hypothesise that if 8OH-EFV is a substrate, patients possessing the *ABCB1* 3435TT variant would be at greater risk of CNS toxicity as a result of reduced efflux at the blood–brain barrier.\n\nConcerns regarding EFV-induced toxicities and discontinuations due to these toxicities have recently led to alterations in HIV treatment guidelines in the UK and US, replacing EFV with integrase inhibitor-based (raltegravir, dolutegravir, elvitegravir–cobicistat) regimens, or boosted darunavir- or atazanavir-containing regimens as the preferred first-line treatment for therapy-naïve adults [[31](#CR31), [32](#CR32)]. Although recommended as an alternative agent in developed countries, EFV remains the first-line option for treatment-naïve patients in resource-limited settings due to the lack of availability of newer compounds [[1](#CR1)]. Lower rates of EFV-related adverse events (Stocrin^®^ product information and clinician decision) were experienced with EFV400 compared with EFV600. Moreover, EFV600 was independently associated with a 154 % higher risk of stopping due to EFV-related adverse events (clinician decision). Improved tolerability of EFV400 would therefore prove beneficial, lowering discontinuations and preserving future treatment options for longer.\n\nEFV plays a key role in the treatment of HIV/tuberculosis (TB) co-infection [[1](#CR1)] and is a recommended option for HIV-infected pregnant women [[33](#CR33), [34](#CR34)]. Rifampicin and isoniazid, essential components of TB therapy, are known to alter the EFV metabolic pathway through potent induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, and inhibition of CYP2A6, respectively [[35](#CR35), [36](#CR36)]. However, adequate HIV suppression has been observed in HIV/TB patients receiving EFV600 in the presence of TB medications [[37](#CR37)]. Differential effects of rifampicin on CYP2B6 induction according to genotype have been reported with greater effects observed in those with fully functional CYP2B6, leading to lower EFV concentrations in the presence of rifampicin compared with EFV alone [[38](#CR38)] and potentially placing these patients at higher risk of failure. The impact of TB therapy on EFV400 has not been studied and PK–PD data are necessary before considering EFV dose reduction in this patient population.\n\nEFV PK–PD data during pregnancy and post-partum are increasing. Some studies suggest little clinical impact of pregnancy on EFV PK [[39](#CR39), [40](#CR40)], however others have reported increased CL/F, particularly in extensive metabolisers [[35](#CR35), [41](#CR41)], but cases of mother-to-child transmission were rare [[35](#CR35)]. In the absence of clinical evidence, EFV dose reduction in this distinct population is not recommended; however, a clinical study to investigate the PK of EFV400 during pregnancy is planned in virologically-suppressed (pVL <50 copies/mL), HIV-infected women stable on EFV600 [[42](#CR42)].\n\n## Conclusions\n\nENCORE1 has demonstrated successful antiretroviral dose reduction, striking a balance between sustained virological responses with fewer adverse events. Although a threshold concentration may be clinically valuable, it was not associated with HIV suppression in ENCORE1 patients and may be of questionable use in resource-limited settings where routine drug measurement is not performed. Implementation of EFV dose reduction to 400 mg once daily would improve toxicity management whilst maintaining durable efficacy and would reduce drug costs, allowing greater treatment coverage. Potentially, the savings made could also aid funding of other public health initiatives such as HIV prevention and education strategies.\n\n## Electronic supplementary material\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\n## Compliance with Ethical Standards\n\nThe authors would like to thank all the patients who volunteered to participate in this study.\n\nENCORE1 substudies were funded through a project grant from the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC; APP1048402).

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of CYP2C19 variants in Syrian patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and evaluate the impact of these variants on the clinical efficacy of a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\n\n**Methods:** \nThis study included 50 Syrian CAD patients on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel. CYP2C19 genotypes were determined by PCR, followed by Sanger sequencing. Clinical outcomes, including major acute cardiovascular events (MACE) and bleeding events, were monitored over 18–24 months.\n\n**Results:** \nThe allele frequencies were 8% for CYP2C19*2, 0% for CYP2C19*3, and 17% for CYP2C19*17. The distribution of our study population by CYP2C19 genotype-predicted metabolizer phenotypes was 56% for normal metabolizers (NMs), 26% for intermediate metabolizers (IMs), 12% for rapid metabolizers (RMs), and 2% for ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs). No association was found between the CYP2C19*2 allele and recurrent ischemic events or between the CYP2C19*17 allele and bleeding complications in patients treated with a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel.\n\n**Conclusions:** \nIn Syrian patients undergoing PCI, a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel (150 mg/day) may help mitigate variability in response due to CYP2C19*2 carrier status, offering potential benefits in optimizing antiplatelet therapy. However, given the study’s limited sample size, these findings should be interpreted with caution, and larger studies are needed to confirm this potential benefit.\n\n**Supplementary Information:** \nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12872-025-04768-8.\n\nKeywords: Clopidogrel, Doubled maintenance dose, CYP2C19, Genotyping, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C19*17, Syria\n\n### Background\n\nGenetic variations in the *CYP2C19* gene, which encodes the major enzyme responsible for activating clopidogrel, may influence response to Clopidogrel antiplatelet therapy.

No association was found between the *CYP2C19*2* allele and recurrent ischemic events or between the *CYP2C19*17* allele and bleeding complications in patients treated with a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nIn Syrian patients undergoing PCI, a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel (150 mg/day) may help mitigate variability in response due to *CYP2C19*2* carrier status, offering potential benefits in optimizing antiplatelet therapy. However, given the study’s limited sample size, these findings should be interpreted with caution, and larger studies are needed to confirm this potential benefit.\n\n### Supplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12872-025-04768-8.\n\n## Background\n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD), also known as ischemic heart disease (IHD), is a widespread health condition and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, primarily arising due to atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries [[1](#CR1)]. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a minimally invasive, nonsurgical procedure utilized in the management of IHD, with the aim of relieving the stenosis or obstruction of coronary arteries by restoring blood flow to the affected area, commonly achieved by inflating a balloon or deploying a stent [[2](#CR2)]. Following stenting, a dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is administered to patients, comprising aspirin and an oral P2Y12 receptor antagonist (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor), to prevent stent thrombosis and reduce the likelihood of major acute cardiovascular events (MACE) [[3](#CR3)].\n\nClopidogrel, a second-generation thienopyridine, is a prodrug absorbed through the intestines via the P-glycoprotein pump following oral administration. Once absorbed, it undergoes metabolism via two primary pathways. The first pathway involves esterase enzymes, resulting in the hydrolysis of clopidogrel to a non-active carboxylic acid derivative, which accounts for 85% of the parent drug. The second pathway involves two sequential oxidative steps mediated by a group of cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP2C19. The initial step involves the oxidation of clopidogrel to an intermediate metabolite, 2-oxo-clopidogrel, followed by a second step in which an active thiol metabolite is formed [[4](#CR4)]. The resulting metabolite specifically and irreversibly binds to the P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate receptors on platelets, inhibiting platelet aggregation and preventing blood clot formation [[5](#CR5)]. Despite the well-established benefits of clopidogrel, a considerable portion of patients exhibit a limited response to its antiplatelet effect, leading to recurrent ischemic events after PCI [[6](#CR6)].\n\nThe response to clopidogrel has substantial interpatient variability, which has received close attention. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed, likely to be multifactorial, depending on pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacogenomic factors. Considering that the CYP2C19 enzyme plays a pivotal role in the hepatic activation of clopidogrel, the examination of CYP2C19 polymorphisms has come to the forefront of clopidogrel pharmacogenetic research [[7](#CR7)].\n\nThe *CYP2C19* gene is located on chromosome 10q23.33 within the *CYP2C* gene cluster and comprises nine coding exons and eight introns. This gene is highly polymorphic, with the Pharmacogene Variation (PharmVar) Consortium cataloging over 35 different star alleles, each with varying levels of evidence. The majority of these alleles result from specific combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while a few arise from copy number variation (CNV), such as the **36* and **37* alleles, which represent complete and partial deletion of the *CYP2C19* gene, respectively [[9](#CR9), [10](#CR10)]. The most common non-functional alleles that contribute to poor and intermediate metabolizer phenotypes are *CYP2C19*2* (rs4244285; c.681G > A) and *CYP2C19*3* (rs4986893; c.636G > A). In contrast, *CYP2C19*17* (rs12248560; -806 C > T) is a gain-of-function allele associated with increased gene transcription, resulting in rapid metabolizers (RMs) or ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs) depending on the copy number of the *CYP2C19*17* allele that the individual carries [[9](#CR9)].\n\nConsidering the absence of studies reporting the prevalence of *CYP2C19* polymorphisms in the Syrian population, a highly admixed Mediterranean population, our study aimed to determine the frequencies of the most clinically relevant *CYP2C19* alleles among Syrian patients undergoing PCI and assess the impact of these genetic variations on the clinical response to a double maintenance dose of clopidogrel presented by patients’ cardiovascular outcomes.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and ethics approval\n\nThis prospective cohort study was approved by the Scientific Research Bioethics Committee of the Faculty of Pharmacy, Damascus University, in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all individuals who participated in the study in compliance with ethical standards.\n\n### Sample collection\n\nBetween June 2020 and January 2021, patient eligibility assessments were conducted at three medical institutions in Damascus, Syria: Martyr Bassel al-Assad Heart Hospital, Damascus Hospital, and Al Fayhaa Hospital. The inclusion criteria were CAD patients aged 18 years or older who underwent PCI and were prescribed DAPT with a double maintenance dose of clopidogrel 150 mg/day (for at least one month after PCI). Patients were excluded if they were prescribed the standard dose of Clopidogrel (75 mg/day), or if they were taking other adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists like Ticagrelor or Prasugrel. Eligible patients participated in face-to-face interviews, during which relevant information (Additional File [1](#MOESM1)), such as age, gender, body weight, height, smoking status, medical history, and concomitant medication use, were recorded. Furthermore, a peripheral blood sample (5 mL) was collected from each participant using an EDTA tube.\n\n### DNA extraction\n\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from whole blood samples using a Blood DNA Preparation Solution Kit (Jena Bioscience^®^, Jena, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality and purity of the extracted gDNA were assessed using a NanoDrop device (MaestroGen^®^, Hsinchu City, Taiwan). For analysis, two µL of gDNA were loaded onto the lens of the NanoDrop and measured at a wavelength of 260/280 nm. The NanoDrop lens was meticulously cleaned with distilled water and a cotton swab after each measurement to ensure accuracy and prevent contamination. Subsequent measurements were performed on the remaining samples.\n\n### CYP2C19 *2, *3 and *17 genotyping\n\nGenotyping of *CYP2C19*2* (rs4244285), *CYP2C19*3* (rs4986893), and *CYP2C19*17* (rs12248560) was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by Sanger sequencing of the amplicons. The PCR reactions were carried out using the Labcycler Basic (011–103) device (SensoQuest GmbH^®^, Göttingen, Germany), using specific primers and implementing the conditions outlined in Table [1](#Tab1). The targeted locations of the forward and reverse primers for each investigated SNP are illustrated in Fig. [1](#Fig1). a. Each PCR reaction had a final volume of 20 µl and included 50 ng of gDNA, five pmol of 10 pmol/µL of each the forward and reverse primer, and ten µl of 2X Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems^®^, Wilmington, USA). The resulting PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis using a (1.5%) agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet (UV) light (Additional File [2](#MOESM1)). The observed bands were documented using a digital camera and compared to a 100-bp DNA ladder for identification purposes. Subsequently, 150 PCR amplification products were sent to Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea) for sequencing.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Allele | Primers |  | PCR Conditions |  |  |  | Product Size |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Step | TmoC | Time | # of Cycles |  |  |  |  |\n| CYP2C19*2 | F | 5′-ACAACCAGAGCTTGGCATATT-3′ | Initial Denaturation | 95 | 5 min |   | 203 bp |\n| Denaturation | 95 | 20 s | 40 |  |  |  |  |\n| Primer Annealing | 54.4 | 30 s |  |  |  |  |  |\n| R | 5′-TGTCCATCGATTCTTGGTGT-3′ | Extension | 72 | 30 s |  |  |  |\n| Final Extension | 72 | 10 min |   |  |  |  |  |\n| CYP2C19*3 | F | 5′-ATTGTTTCCAATCATTTAGCTTCAC-3′ | Initial Denaturation | 94 | 5 min |   | 269 bp |\n| Denaturation | 94 | 1 min | 37 |  |  |  |  |\n| Primer Annealing | 52 | 45 s |  |  |  |  |  |\n| R | 5′-ACTTCAGGGCTTGGTCAATA-3 | Extension | 72 | 30 s |  |  |  |\n| Final Extension | 72 | 5 min |   |  |  |  |  |\n| CYP2C19*17 | F | 5′-GCCCTTAGCACCAAATTCTC-3′ | Initial Denaturation | 95 | 3 min |   | 473 bp |\n| Denaturation | 94 | 1 min | 35 |  |  |  |  |\n| Primer Annealing | 56.3 | 1 min |  |  |  |  |  |\n| R | 5′-ATTTAACCCCCTAAAAAAACACG-3′ | Extension | 72 | 1 min |  |  |  |\n| Final Extension | 72 | 10 min |   |  |  |  |  |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Primers sequences and PCR conditions\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/edc7/12036300/4e9b022947fa/12872_2025_4768_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12036300_12872_2025_4768_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nSchematic representation of the CYP2C19 gene location, structure, studied SNPs, and primer positions.

The dotted lines depict the PCR product lengths for each primer set\n\nSequencing reactions were performed using the MJ Research PTC-225 Peltier Thermal Cycler device and ABI PRISM^®^BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit with AmpliTaq^®^ DAN polymerase (Applied Biosystems^®^, Waltham, USA). The resulting fluorescently labeled fragments were purified to remove unincorporated terminators using the BigDye^®^ XTerminator™ purification protocol. The purified samples were resuspended in distilled water and subjected to electrophoresis using an ABI 3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems^®^, Waltham, USA). Geneious Prime^®^ software (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) was used to analyze the sequencing chromatograms and to identify the frequencies of the studied alleles (Additional File [3](#MOESM1)). Moreover, by using the length of the PCR products, we were able to screen for four additional core SNPs (rs6413438, rs140278421, rs375781227, and rs370803989) that define the **10*, **22*,**26*, and **33* alleles, respectively.\n\n### Phenotype prediction\n\nPatient phenotypes were classified according to the guidelines established by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) for CYP2C19 Genotype and Clopidogrel Therapy, updated in January 2022. According to these guidelines, individuals who carry two copies of the gain-of-function allele *CYP2C19*17* are considered ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs). Those with one copy of the *CYP2C19*17* allele and one copy of the normal function allele *CYP2C19*1* are classified as rapid metabolizers (RMs). Individuals carrying two copies of the normal function allele *CYP2C19*1* are designated as normal metabolizers (NMs). In contrast, individuals with one copy of a non-functional allele (either *CYP2C19*2* or *CYP2C19*3*) along with either a normal function or gain-of-function allele are designated as intermediate metabolizers (IMs). Finally, patients with two copies of a non-functional allele are categorized as poor metabolizers (PMs).\n\n### Follow-up\n\nA follow-up period of 18-24 months was conducted for patients, during which they were contacted via phone calls. The purpose of this follow-up was to assess adherence to the prescribed medication regimen and evaluate the occurrence of any subsequent cardiovascular events following the PCI procedure. The assessed cardiovascular events included refractory angina symptoms, MACE, and bleeding events.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nData were analyzed using GraphPad Prism^®^ 9.2.0 (283) (GraphPad Software Inc., California, USA) and SPSS^®^ version 26 (IBM Corp, NY, USA). Categorical data were represented as frequency and percentage, while quantitative data that showed a normal distribution were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Genotype frequencies were tested for deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using chi-square analysis. The relationship between genetic and non-genetic variables and clinical responsiveness to clopidogrel was analyzed using the chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. A two-sided P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance in all performed tests.\n\n## Results\n\n### Patients’ characteristics\n\n59 CAD patients undergoing PCI were evaluated, and 51 of these subjects met the inclusion criteria, as illustrated in Fig. [2](#Fig2). The general characteristics of the study population in the current research were summarized and categorized in Table [2](#Tab2). The study population comprised 32 males and 18 females. The mean age of the patients was 57.67 ± 9.26 years. The study investigated other clinical features of patients and found that (56%) had hypertension, (28%) had diabetes, and (52%) had a family history of CAD. Furthermore, (12%) of the patients reported a previous PCI, (50%) reported being smokers, and (44%) had a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n### Fig. 2.\n\n![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/edc7/12036300/805a1b6f9824/12872_2025_4768_Fig2_HTML.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12036300_12872_2025_4768_Fig2_HTML.jpg)\n\nFlow diagram for study participants\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Mean age, y (SD) | 57.67 (1.35) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gender |   |\n| Male | 32 (64%) |\n| Female | 18 (32%) |\n| BMI by class |   |\n| Normal | 15 (30%) |\n| Overweight | 20 (40%) |\n| Obese | 15 (30%) |\n| Current smoker | 25 (50%) |\n| Sedentary lifestyle | 22 (44%) |\n| Medical history |   |\n| Hypertension | 28 (56%) |\n| Diabetes | 14 (28%) |\n| CAD FH | 26 (52%) |\n| Previous PCI | 6 (12%) |\n| Comedications |   |\n| Statin | 50 (100%) |\n| ACEIs/ARBs | 26 (52%) |\n| Beta blocker | 37 (74%) |\n| CCB | 12 (24%) |\n| Aspirin | 50 (100%) |\n| PPIs | 24 (48%) |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Baseline demographics of study participants\n\n### Allelic and genotypic distribution of the CYP2C19 polymorphisms\n\nTable [3](#Tab3) displays the allelic distribution frequencies of the investigated SNPs within the *CYP2C19* gene. The frequency of the *CYP2C19*2* allele was found to be (8%) with only one individual homozygous for this non-functional allele, resulting in a frequency of (2%) for the (**2/*2*) genotype. The allelic frequency of *CYP2C19*17* was determined to be (17%), with (4%) of the participants carrying the homozygous (**17/*17*) genotype, and (26%) were heterozygous wild-type (**1/*17*). The other examined alleles (*CYP2C19*3*, **10*, **22*, **26*, and **33*) were not detected in the study population. The genotype frequencies were not significantly different from those predicted by the Hardy–Weinberg equation (Rx^2^ = 3.023; P value = 0.082; Table [4](#Tab4)). The distribution of patients by CYP2C19 phenotypes was as follows: UMs (4%), RMs (26%), NMs (56%), IMs (12%), and PMs (2%) (Table [4](#Tab4)).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n| Allele | rsID number | Nucleis Acid Base Substitution | Frequency |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CYP2C19*2 | rs4244285 | 19,154 G > A | 0.08 |\n| CYP2C19*3 | rs4986893 | 17,948 G > A | 0 |\n| CYP2C19*10 | rs6413438 | 19,153 C > T | 0 |\n| CYP2C19*17 | rs12248560 | −806 C > A / C > T | 0.17 |\n| CYP2C19*22 | rs140278421 | 17,869 G > A / G > C / G > T | 0 |\n| CYP2C19*26 | rs375781227 | 19,239 G > A | 0 |\n| CYP2C19*33 | rs370803989 | 17,874 G > A | 0 |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Studied CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| Phenotype | N (%) | Genotype | N (%)Observed | N (%)Expected | HWE x2 | HWE P value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| UMs | 2 (4%) | *17/*17 | 2 (4%) | 1.44 (2.89%) | 0.2131 | 0.64 |\n| RMs | 13 (26%) | *1/*17 | 13 (26%) | 12.75 (25.5%) | 0.0049 | 0.94 |\n| NMs | 28 (56%) | *1/*1 | 28 (56%) | 28.13 (56.25%) | 0.00055 | 0.98 |\n| IMs | 6 (12%) | *1/*2 | 6 (12%) | 6 (12%) | 0 | 1 |\n| *1/*3 | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | NA | NA |  |  |\n| *17/*2 | 0 (0%) | 1.36 (2.72%) | 1.36 | 0.24 |  |  |\n| *17/*3 | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | NA | NA |  |  |\n| PMs | 1 (2%) | *2/*2 | 1 (2%) | 0.32 (0.64%) | 1.445 | 0.22 |\n| *2/*3 | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | NA | NA |  |  |\n| *3/*3 | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | NA | NA |  |  |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Observed versus expected genotype distribution of CYP2C19\n\n### Follow-up\n\nOut of all the patients initially included in the study, nine individuals could not be followed up. Among the remaining 41 patients for whom data were available, 16 patients (39%) reported experiencing recurrent angina symptoms. Additionally, two individuals (4.88%) experienced MACE, and four patients (9.76%) reported bleeding events.\n\n### Refractory angina symptoms and CYP2C19 polymorphism\n\nAs represented in Table [5](#Tab5), it was found that two patients (33.33%) from the *CYP2C19*2* allele carrier group exhibited symptoms of refractory angina. However, this result did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference when compared with the non-carrier group, in which 14 patients (%38.89) exhibited similar symptoms (*P* > 0.9999).\n\n### Table 5.\n\n| Allele CYP2C19*2 | Refractory angina symptoms |  | P value | Major adverse cardiac events |  | P value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yes | No | Yes | No |  |  |  |\n| Yes | 2 (%33.33) | 4 (%66.67) | >0.9999 | 1 (%16.67) | 5 (%83.33) | 0.2744 |\n| No | 14 (%38.89) | 22 (%61.11) | 1 (%2.86) | 34 (%97.14) |  |  |\n\nTable 5 Caption: Distribution of recurrent cardiac ischemic events by CYP2C19*2 polymorphism\n\n### Major adverse cardiac events and CYP2C19 polymorphism\n\nOverall, two of the 41 patients who were followed up in the study experienced at least one MACE after PCI. One case was from the *CYP2C19*2* allele carrier group and the other was from the non-carrier group. In terms of the distribution of MACE based on *CYP2C19*2* status, there was no statistically significant correlation (*P* = 0.2744).\n\n### Recurrent cardiac ischemic events and non-genetic factors\n\nThe distribution of refractory angina symptoms and MACE among patients according to various demographic and clinical factors is presented in Table [6](#Tab6). Statistical analyses were conducted to investigate the association between these factors and the clinical response to Clopidogrel, particularly regarding the incidence of recurrent cardiovascular events. The results indicated that the P-value in all tests exceeded 0.05, suggesting no significant association between these factors and cardiovascular events. Specifically, no significant relationship was found between MACE and factors such as gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, proton pump inhibitor use, or calcium channel blocker use. These findings highlight the absence of a clear link between these non-genetic factors and major cardiovascular events in the studied population.\n\n### Table 6.\n\n| Variables |  | Refractory angina symptoms |  | P value | Major adverse cardiac events |  | P value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yes | No | Yes | No |  |  |  |  |\n| Gender | Male | 4 (14.81%) | 23 (85.19%) | > 0.9999 | 0 (0%) | 27 (100%) | 0.1228 |\n| Female | 2 (14.28%) | 12 (85.71%) | 2 (14.28%) | 12 (85.71%) |  |  |  |\n| BMI | Normal | 1 (7.69%) | 12 (92.31%) | 0.19134 | 0 (0%) | 13 (100%) | 0.1317 |\n| Overweight | 1 (7.14%) | 13 (92.86%) | 0 (0%) | 14 (100%) |  |  |  |\n| Obese | 4 (28.57%) | 10 (71.42%) | 2 (14.28%) | 12 (85.72%) |  |  |  |\n| Hypertension | Yes | 4 (12.90%) | 27 (87.10%) | 0.6221 | 1 (4.76%) | 20 (95.24%) | > 0.9999 |\n| No | 2 (10%) | 18 (90%) | 1 (5%) | 19 (95%) |  |  |  |\n| Diabetes | Yes | 3 (27.27%) | 8 (72.73%) | 0.3162 | 1 (9.1%) | 10 (90.9%) | 0.4695 |\n| No | 3 (10%) | 27 (90%) | 1 (3.33%) | 29 (96.77%) |  |  |  |\n| Proton Pump Inhibitor Use | Yes | 4 (18.18%) | 18 (81.82%) | 0.6681 | 0 (0%) | 22 (100%) | 0.2085 |\n| No | 2 (10.52%) | 17 (89.47%) | 2 (10.53%) | 17 (89.47%) |  |  |  |\n| Calcium Chanel Blockers Use | Yes | 3 (30%) | 7 (70%) | 0.1435 | 0 (0%) | 10 (100%) | > 0.9999 |\n| No | 3 (9.67%) | 28 (90.33%) | 2 (6.45%) | 29 (93.55%) |  |  |  |\n\nTable 6 Caption: Distribution of recurrent cardiac ischemic events by non-genetic factors\n\n### Bleeding events and CYP2C19 polymorphism\n\nOur results indicated that carriers of the *CYP2C19*17* variant experienced a higher incidence of bleeding events (16.67%) compared to non-carriers (6.9%). Despite this observed difference, it is important to note that the statistical analysis found no significant difference between the two groups (*P* = 0.567; see Table [7](#Tab7)). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in bleeding events between *CYP2C19*2* carriers and non-carriers (*P* = 0.0952; see Table [7](#Tab7)), although a higher proportion of bleeding events was observed among carriers.\n\n### Table 7.\n\n| Allele CYP2C19*17 | Bleeding events |  | P value | Allele CYP2C19*2 | Bleeding events |  | P value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yes | No | Yes | No |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes | 2 (16.67%) | 10 (83.33%) | 0.567 | Yes | 2 (33.33%) | 4 (66.67%) | 0.0952 |\n| No | 2 (6.9%) | 27 (93.1%) | No | 2 (5.71%) | 33 (94.29%) |  |  |\n\nTable 7 Caption: Distribution of bleeding events by CYP2C19 polymorphism\n\n## Discussion\n\nDual antiplatelet therapy, consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, is the current recommended treatment strategy for patients with CAD undergoing PCI with stent implantation to reduce the risk of recurrent MACE [[27](#CR27)]. Although novel P2Y12 inhibitors, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor are becoming more popular due to their strong antiplatelet effects [[28](#CR28)–[30](#CR30)], clopidogrel remains the most widely prescribed drug of P2Y12 inhibitors in Syria. This preference is primarily due to its lower cost and reduced risk of bleeding. However, most Syrian physicians tend to duplicate the maintenance dose of clopidogrel for at least one month after stenting to provide additional prevention of recurrent ischemic events, including stent thrombosis. However, despite clopidogrel’s general effectiveness, various studies have shown that a significant number of patients (between 5% and 44%) may not respond adequately to this medication [[31](#CR31)]. Clopidogrel response has been attributed to be affected by several factors, which can be categorized as clinical, cellular, and genetic. Polymorphism of *CYP2C19* gene is one of the key genetic factors influencing individual responses to clopidogrel [[32](#CR32), [33](#CR33)].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Syria reporting allelic frequencies of *CYP2C19*2*, **3*, and **17* and assessing their impact on the clinical efficacy and safety of a double maintenance dose of clopidogrel as part of DAPT in CAD patients undergoing PCI. The Syrian population is a highly admixed community with diverse ethnic, cultural, and religious groups, resulting from historical factors such as immigration, political occupations, and trade relations with various countries over the centuries. This diversity has created a unique genetic makeup, making it important to conduct genetic studies specific to this population.\n\nThe frequency of *CYP2C19*2* allele in our study population (8%) was found to be compatible with that of other populations in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, such as the Jordanian (9.8%) [[11](#CR11)], Iraqi (11.7%) [[14](#CR14)], Saudi (9.9%) [[17](#CR17)], Egyptian (12.6%) [[15](#CR15)], and Tunisian (9%) [[18](#CR18)]. However, a noteworthy variation was observed when comparing our results to East Asian populations, such as Chinese (24.7%) [[25](#CR25)] and Japanese (27.9%) [[24](#CR24)]. The *CYP2C19*3* allele was absent in our study population, which aligns with the low or diminished frequencies reported in European and Middle Eastern populations. In contrast, this allele has a higher prevalence in Asian populations, ranging from 3.3% in China [[25](#CR25)] to 12.8% in Japan [[24](#CR24)]. This suggests a notable ethnic difference between Caucasian and Oriental populations, indicating that this genetic variant likely emerged relatively recently after the differentiation of these groups [[21](#CR21)]. For the *CYP2C9*17* allele, the frequency was found to be (17%), which is close to that reported in European and Middle Eastern populations but higher than those found in other studies on Asians (from 0.3% in Koreans [[26](#CR26)] to 1.3% in Japanese [[23](#CR23)]). Table [8](#Tab8) summarizes the frequencies of the studied alleles across different countries and populations.\n\n### Table 8.\n\n| Country | *2 allele frequency (%) | *3 allele frequency (%) | *17 allele frequency (%) | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Syria | 8 | 0 | 17 | Current study |\n| Lebanon | 13.4 | 0.3 | NE | [1] |\n| Jordan | 9.8 | 0 | 28.72 | [2, 3] |\n| Palestine | 15.5 | 2.3 | NE | [4] |\n| Iraq | 11.7 | 0 | 27.6 | [5] |\n| Egypt | 12.6 | 0.25 | 17 | [6] |\n| Qatar | 13 | 0.4 | 21 | [7] |\n| Saudi Arabia | 9.9 | 0.1 | 25.7 | [8] |\n| Tunisia | 9 | 0 | 21.3 | [9] |\n| Turkey | 15.27 | 0.43 | 15.85 | [10] |\n| Iran | 16.5 | 0.1 | 21.78 | [11] |\n| Italy | 11 | 0 | 20.3 | [12] |\n| Greek | 13.07 | 0 | 19.61 | [13] |\n| Japan | 27.9 | 12.8 | 1.3 | [14, 15] |\n| China | 24.7 | 3.3 | 1.2 | [16] |\n| Korea | 28 | 11 | 0.3 | [17] |\n\nTable 8 Caption: Comparison of allele frequencies of CYP2C19*2, *3, and *17 reported from different ethnic populations\n\nThe present study did not confirm an association between MACE incidence and the carrier status of the non-functional *CYP2C19*2* allele, which has been established in many previous studies and meta-analyses [[34](#CR34)–[39](#CR39)]. Numerous prominent international medicine and regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), Health Canada/Santé Canada (HCSC), and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan, have incorporated pharmacogenomics (PGx)-relevant annotations into the clopidogrel drug label under the “Prescribing” section. These annotations indicate that the antiplatelet efficacy of clopidogrel may be impaired or absent in certain patient groups carrying loss-of-function alleles of the *CYP2C19* gene [[40](#CR40)–[43](#CR43)]. Furthermore, extensive literature reviews have been conducted, leading to the development of clinical practice guidelines by professional organizations such as the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium, the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG), and the French National Network of Pharmacogenetics (RNPGx). These guidelines specifically address clopidogrel and *CYP2C19* genotyping, recommending various approaches based on the patient’s CYP2C19 phenotype [[44](#CR44)–[46](#CR46)]. The recommendations provided by the DPWG team suggest considering alternative antiplatelet treatments or doubling the dose of clopidogrel for patients with the Intermediate Metabolizer (IM) phenotype [[45](#CR45)]. This may explain the findings of our study. In our study population, all patients who carried the *CYP2C19*2* allele and were followed up demonstrated the IM phenotype of the CYP2C19 enzyme, as they carried a single copy of the *CYP2C19*2* allele. These patients were prescribed a double maintenance dose of clopidogrel (150 mg/day) for at least one month following (PCI) procedure, as directed by their treating physician. It is possible that by increasing the clopidogrel dosage in individuals with the IM phenotype, sufficient platelet inhibition could have been achieved, potentially reducing the occurrence of recurrent ischemic events.\n\nOur study revealed a noteworthy observation regarding the incidence of bleeding events among the patients we investigated. Despite 30% of the individuals carrying the gain-of-function *CYP2C19*17* allele and receiving a double maintenance dose of clopidogrel after stent placement, the occurrence of hemorrhagic events remained relatively low, not exceeding (9.7%). Several potential explanations for these findings include limitations related to the study population size, medication adherence, loss to follow-up, and various clinical and genetic factors.\n\nThe *CYP2C19*17* allele is well-known to be associated with increased CYP2C19 enzyme activity. However, the clinical significance of this allele remains a topic of ongoing controversy. Although several studies, including a comprehensive meta-analysis, have confirmed that individuals carrying the *CYP2C19*17* allele are at an elevated risk of bleeding events when treated with a standard dose of clopidogrel [[47](#CR47)–[49](#CR49)], conflicting evidence has been reported [[50](#CR50)]. In addition to the conflicting evidence, therapeutic recommendations vary among different guidelines issued by professional organizations in the field of pharmacogenetics for patients undergoing (PCI) and carrying the *CYP2C19*17* allele [[44](#CR44)–[46](#CR46)]. Given these controversies and inconsistencies, further research is needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical implications of the *CYP2C19*17* allele and its impact on treatment outcomes, particularly in patients undergoing PCI.\n\nIn addition to the extensively studied *CYP2C19*, several other genes have been investigated in the literature because of their potential impact on the metabolism and effective concentration of the active metabolites of clopidogrel. These genes included *ABCB1* [[51](#CR51)], *CYP2C9* [[52](#CR52)], *CYP3A4/5* [[53](#CR53)], *PON1* [[54](#CR54)], and *CES1* [[55](#CR55)]. Within the *ABCB1* gene, a SNP known as C3435T (rs1045642) has been associated with a higher incidence of ischemic cardiac events in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with clopidogrel. This SNP has been linked to potential sub-therapeutic concentrations of clopidogrel, primarily resulting from decreased intestinal absorption of the drug [[51](#CR51)]. The frequency of this genetic variant varies among populations. High frequencies have been observed in nearby Middle Eastern populations, such as Jordanians (58%) [[56](#CR56)], Palestinians (46%) [[57](#CR57)], and Lebanese (50.8%) [[58](#CR58)], making it possible that this SNP could be present in a substantial percentage within our study population.\n\nOne of the main limitations of this study was the small number of participants, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study did not include laboratory evaluation of Clopidogrel responsiveness through platelet function testing. Such testing could have provided valuable insights into the pharmacodynamic effect of clopidogrel in relation to *CYP2C19* polymorphisms and further strengthened the interpretation of our findings. It is crucial to acknowledge that this research represents an initial step towards investigating the genetic profile of the Syrian community in relation to the double maintenance dose of clopidogrel. The utilization of a robust genotyping method (amplicon Sanger sequencing) bolsters the reliability of the genetic data obtained. As such, the findings of this study should be interpreted as modest contributions to the existing literature rather than definitive evidence. Further research with larger sample sizes, more diverse populations, and rigorous study designs is necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors influencing clopidogrel response within the Syrian community.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nAmong patients who underwent PCI and were treated with a double maintenance dose of clopidogrel, the carrier status of the *CYP2C19*2* allele does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of MACE. This finding could potentially support the increased clopidogrel dosing strategy depending on the *CYP2C19* genotype. Nonetheless, given the widespread use of clopidogrel for the treatment of patients undergoing PCI, further evidence regarding the impact of adjusting clopidogrel dosage or utilizing alternative antiplatelet therapy for *CYP2C19* non-functional alleles carriers is necessary.\n\n## Electronic supplementary material\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to express our sincere appreciation to Professor Majd N.

The adverse events are unpredictable and carry significant morbidity and mortality. To identify genetic markers for allopurinol–SCAR, we carried out a case-control association study. We enrolled 51 patients with allopurinol–SCAR and 228 control individuals (135 allopurinol-tolerant subjects and 93 healthy subjects from the general population), and genotyped for 823 SNPs in genes related to drug metabolism and immune response. The initial screen revealed strong association between allopurinol–SCAR and SNPs in the MHC region, including BAT3 (encoding HLA-B associated transcript 3), MSH5 (mutS homolog 5), and MICB (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence B) (P < 10–7). We then determined the alleles of HLA loci A, B, C, and DRB1. The HLA-B*5801 allele was present in all (100%) 51 patients with allopurinol–SCAR, but only in 20 (15%) of 135 tolerant patients [odds ratio 580.3 (95% confidence interval, 34.4–9780.9); corrected P value = 4.7 × 10–24] and in 19 (20%) of 93 of healthy subjects [393.51 (23.23–6665.26); corrected P value = 8.1 × 10–18]. HLA alleles A*3303, Cw*0302, and DRB1*0301 were in linkage disequilibrium and formed an extended haplotype with HLA-B*5801. Our results indicated that allopurinol–SCAR is strongly associated with a genetic predisposition in Han Chinese. In particular, HLA-B*5801 allele is an important genetic risk factor for this life-threatening condition.\n\nKeywords: adverse drug reactions, genetic polymorphism, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, pharmacogenetics\n\n## Methods\n\n**Patients and Control Subjects Recruitment.** From 1996 to 2004, 93 individuals who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of SJS, TEN, or HSS induced by allopurinol were identified in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) Health System, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei Medical University Hospital, and Taichung Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan. Among them, 51 patients agreed to participate in the study. All patients were assessed by two dermatologists, who reviewed photographs, pathological slides, and medical records. The diagnostic criteria of SJS/TEN were based on the clinical morphology defined by Roujeau ([9](#ref9)). We define SJS as skin detachment of <10% of body-surface area, overlap SJS/TEN as skin detachment of 10–30%, and TEN as >30%. The criteria for HSS were cutaneous rash (e.g., diffuse macuopapular, exfoliative dermatitis), plus two of the following symptoms: eosinophilia, atypical circulating lymphocytes, leukocytosis, acute hepatocellular injury, or worsening renal function ([5](#ref5)). In all enrolled cases, allopurinol was regarded as the offending drug if the onset of SCAR symptoms occurred within first 3 months of allopurinol exposure and the symptoms resolved upon withdrawal of the drug. Patients with an absence of symptoms after reexposure to allopurinol and patients with milder skin eruption that did not meet the criteria of HSS, SJS, and TEN were excluded.\n\nTwo control groups were used in this study. The first control group was the 135 consecutive patients who received allopurinol for at least 6 months without evidence of adverse reactions. These allopurinol-tolerant patients were recruited from the Rheumatology Clinic of the same regional hospitals where allopurinol–SCAR patients were recruited. The second control group consisted of 93 healthy subjects randomly selected from a biobank under a nationwide population study, in which 3,312 Han Chinese descendants were recruited based on the geographic distribution across Taiwan. There was no selfreport of adverse events by any of these 93 subjects. All participants were unrelated Han Chinese residing in Taiwan. There was no difference in the ethnic background among the SCAR patients, tolerant controls, and healthy subjects. The Han Chinese forms the largest ethnic group in Taiwan, making up ≈98% of the population. None of the participants were aboriginal Taiwanese, which account for the remaining 2% of the Taiwan's population.\n\nThe study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all of the participants.\n\n**SNP Genotyping.** A total of 823 SNPs were selected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's SNP database for genotyping (dbSNP build 118) ([10](#ref10)). These included 197 SNPs from 4 Mb of the MHC region on chromosome 6p21.3 ([11](#ref11)) and 626 SNPs selected from genes encoding immune-related molecules and drug metabolizing enzymes (for SNP ID, gene symbol, and chromosome position, see Table 4, which is published as [supporting information](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/0409500102/DC1) on the PNAS web site). The 197 SNPs selected in the MHC region included all 201 SNPs reported by Walsh *et al.* ([11](#ref11)), except for the four SNPs that failed to be genotyped (rs1264314, rs1264440, rs1755038, and rs589428). The other 626 SNPs included genes of apoptosis-related molecules (death-associated proteins, caspases), immune mediators (complement components, immune cell receptors, cytokines), and drug transporters (ATP-binding cassettes). We specifically included genes involved in allopurinol metabolism, which included xanthine oxidase (43 SNPs), aldehyde oxidase (24 SNPs), purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase.\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated by using PUREGENE DNA purification system (Gentra Systems). SNP genotyping was performed by using high-throughput MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Briefly, primers and probes were designed by using SpectroDESIGNER software (Sequenom, San Diego). Multiplex PCRs were performed, and unincorporated dNTPs were dephosphorylated by using shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Hoffman-LaRoche, Basel) followed by primer extension. The purified primer extension reaction was spotted onto a 384-element silicon chip (SpectroCHIP, Sequenom) and analyzed in the Bruker Biflex III MALDI-TOF SpectroREADER mass spectrometer (Sequenom), and the resulting spectra processed with SpectroTYPER (Sequenom).\n\n**HLA Genotyping.** HLA alleles A, B, C, and DRB1, were determined by sequence-specific oligonucleotide reverse lineblot (Dynal, Bromborough, U.K.) ([12](#ref12)). Potential ambiguities were resolved by sequencing-based typing ([13](#ref13)). The primers used for HLA-B allele typing were: Bin1-TA-M13F, 5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGGCGGGGGCGCAGGACCTGA-3′ (forward); Bin1-CGM13F, 5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTCGGGGGCGCAGGACCCGG-3′ (forward); and Bin3-M13R, 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCGGAGGCCATCCCCGGCGACCTAT-3′. Primers for HLA-A allele typing were: Ain1-A-M13F, 5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGGGGCGCARGACCCGGGA-3′ (forward); Ain1-G-M13F, 5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGGGCGCAGGACCGGGG-3′ (forward); Ain1-T-M13F, 5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGGGRCGCAGGACCCGGGT-3′ (forward); and Ain3–62-M13R, 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCGTCCCAATTGTCTCCCCTCCTT-3′ (reverse). Primers for HLA-C allele typing were: 5Cln1–61, 5′-AGCGAGGKGCCCGCCCGGCGA-3′ (forward); and 3BCln3–12, 5′GGAGATGGGGAAGGCTCCCCACT-3′ (reverse). The DRB1 alleles are separated into eight groups, DR1, DR2, DR3/11/6, DR4, DR7, DR8/12, DR9, and DR10, for sequencing-based typing as described ([14](#ref14)). The PCR was set up in a volume of 16 μl, containing 50–100 ng of genomic DNA, 1× PCR buffer [16 mM (NH_4_)_2_SO_4_/67 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.8/0.01% Tween 20], 2.5 mM MgCl_2_, 200 μM each of dNTP, 5% DMSO, 0.02 mg/ml cresol red, and 0. 5 units of EuroTaq polymerase (Euroclone, Spa, Milan). Cycling was carried out by using the described sequencing-based typing protocol ([13](#ref13), [14](#ref14)).\n\n**Statistical Analysis.** Categorical data were compared between groups with use of Fisher's exact tests, and continuous data (presented as median, with range given in parentheses) were compared with use of *t* tests. All *P* values were two-tailed; a *P* value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Allelic association screen was carried out by the Cochran–Armitage Trend test for each SNP ([15](#ref15)). Odds ratios were calculated with Haldane's modification, which adds 0.5 to all cells to accommodate possible zero counts ([16](#ref16)). The corrected *P* (Pc) values were adjusted by using Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons to account for the observed alleles (17 for HLA-A, 40 for HLA-B, 19 for HLA-C, and 30 for HLA-DRB1). Therefore, the Pc values were multiplied by a factor of 387,600.\n\n## Results\n\n**Characteristics of Patients and Controls.** The clinical manifestations of the 51 patients with allopurinol–SCAR, which included SJS (13 cases), SJS/TEN (5 cases), TEN (3 cases), and HSS (30 cases), are summarized in [Table 1](#tbl1). The onset of symptoms for all patients was within the first 3 months of allopurinol exposure, and three patients had a second attack within 2 days of reexposure ([Table 1](#tbl1)). Twenty-one patients received multiple drugs in addition to the allopurinol, but their medical records revealed no adverse drug reactions when these concomitant medications were taken without allopurinol. All patients received allopurinol because of hyperuricemia with or without gouty arthritis ([Table 2](#tbl2)).\n\n### Table 1.

The sex distribution of the tolerant group is comparable to the general prevalence of gout with a male/female ratio ranging from 7:1 to 9:1 ([17](#ref17)), but differed from the allopurinol–SCAR group. The difference can be explained by the fact that there were fewer patients with gouty arthritis in the SCAR group than those in the tolerant group. Chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, systemic lupus erythematous, and asthma were present in both allopurinol–SCAR and tolerant patients. The frequencies of diseases were not significantly different in the two groups except for chronic renal insufficiency, which was seen more frequently in the allopurinol–SCAR group (*P* < 0.0001; [Table 2](#tbl2)). The presence of chronic renal insufficiency increased the risk for allopurinol–SCAR [odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3–9.3]. The frequencies of patients taking thiazide diuretics were not significantly different in the two groups, although concomitant use of the thiazide has been reported to be a risk factor for allopurinol–SCAR ([18](#ref18)). In addition to the tolerant control group, 93 subjects who were randomly selected from the general population of Taiwan were served as an additional control.\n\n**Association Screen for Candidate Gene SNPs.** We initially screened 30 patients with allopurinol–SCAR and 60 tolerant subjects for SNP association. Of the total of 823 SNPs screened (197 SNPs in the MHC region and 626 SNPs of immune-related genes and drug metabolizing genes), 29 SNPs in the MHC region were found to have significant association (*P* < 0.01) with the allopurinol–SCAR patients when compared to the tolerant group ([Fig. 1](#fig1)). In particular, three SNPs in the MHC class III region have *P* values <10^–7^ (–log_10_ *P* value > 7, [Fig. 1](#fig1)). These SNPs were rs3117583 of BAT3 (encoding for HLA-B associated transcript 3), rs1150793 of MSH5 (encoding mutS homolog), and rs2855804 of MICB (encoding MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence).\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ad29/554812/70362dad28e6/zpq0110576610001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=554812_zpq0110576610001.jpg)\n\nScreening of candidate SNPs for association with allopurinol-induced SCAR. On the x axis, 823 SNPs are ordered by their chromosome positions; 197 SNPs in the MHC region are those numbered from 260 to 456. On the y axis, the –log10 P values were calculated by comparison of the genotype frequencies between the allopurinol–SCAR patients and tolerant group.\n\nOutside the MHC region, only three SNPs showed potential associations (*P* < 0.01). Two SNPs (rs2268791 and rs1594) were located in the CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR) gene on chromosome 2, and one SNP (rs2304224) belongs to KIR2DL1 (a killer cell Ig-like receptor) gene on chromosome 19. No other significant associations were found in the other SNPs, including the SNPs of allopurinol drug metabolizing enzymes (see Table 4 for the *P* value of each SNP).\n\nTo replicate the initial screening results, we genotyped additional 21 patients with allopurinol–SCAR, 75 allopurinoltolerant controls, and 93 subjects from the general population for all of the SNPs that had *P* values <0.01. We confirmed the initial observation of the positive association of allopurinol–SCAR with the MHC and CFLAR loci, but not with the KIR2D1 locus.\n\n**HLA Allele Frequency.** Because the most significant association was seen with the SNPs in the MHC region, we genotyped the individual HLA alleles. As shown in [Table 3](#tbl3), alleles HLA-A*3303, B*5801, Cw*0302, and DRB1*0301 occurred at significantly increased frequencies among the allopurinol–SCAR patients compared to the two control groups. In particular, the HLA-B*5801 was present in all 51 (100%) patients with allopurinol–SCAR, but in only 15% (20 of 135) of the allopurinoltolerant group (odds ratio, 580.3; 95% CI, 34.4–9780.9; Pc = 4.7 × 10^–24^), and 20% (19 of 93) of the general population (odds ratio 393.5; 95% CI, 23.2–6665.26; Pc = 8.1 × 10^–18^). This association was only seen with allopurinol–SCAR and not with the patients' underlying diseases, such as gout, renal insufficiency, or autoimmune disease, etc. (data not shown).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n| Genotype | Allopurinol-SCAR (n = 51) | Tolerant control (n = 135) | Odds ratio | Pc value* | General population control (n = 93) | Odds ratio | Pc value* |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| B* 5801 | 51 (100) | 20 (15) | 580.3 | 4.7 × 10-24 | 19 (20) | 393.5 | 8.1 × 10-18 |\n| Cw* 0302 | 48 (94) | 19 (14) | 97.7 | 1.4 × 10-19 | 19 (20) | 62.3 | 2.5 × 10-13 |\n| A* 3303 | 34 (67) | 24 (18) | 9.3 | 2.2 × 10-4 | 20 (22) | 7.3 | 4.7 × 10-2 |\n| DRB1* 0301 | 33 (65) | 17 (13) | 12.7 | 2.8 × 10-6 | 14 (15) | 10.3 | 8.5 × 10-4 |\n| B* 5801, Cw* 0302 | 48 (94) | 19 (14) | 97.7 | 1.4 × 10-19 | 19 (20) | 62.3 | 2.6 × 10-13 |\n| B* 5801, Cw* 0302, A* 3303 | 34 (67) | 17 (13) | 13.9 | 5.4 × 10-7 | 16 (17) | 9.6 | 1.7 × 10-3 |\n| B* 5801, Cw* 0302, DRB1* 0301 | 30 (59) | 11 (8) | 16.1 | 7.4 × 10-7 | 10 (11) | 11.9 | 7.8 × 10-4 |\n| B* 5801, Cw* 0302, A* 3303, DRB1* 0301 | 21 (41) | 9 (7) | 9.8 | 0.039 | 9 (10) | 6.5 | >0.05 |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Frequencies of individual or combined loci of HLA-B* 5801 extended haplotype in patients with allopurinol-induced SCAR, allopurinol tolerant control, and general population control\n\nGuided by five patients (nos. 5, 14, 18, 19, and 35) who were homozygous for the HLA-B*5801 alleles, we analyzed the allele distribution of the combined HLA loci and defined the extended haplotype. The HLA-B*5801 extended haplotype was formed by conserved alleles at closely linked loci as HLA-A*3303-Cw*0302-B*5801-DRB1*0301. This extended haplotype was present in 21 (41%) of the 51 patients with allopurinol–SCAR ([Table 3](#tbl3)), 7% of the tolerant patients, and 10% of the healthy subjects. This extended haplotype has been reported in Taiwanese in a study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ([19](#ref19)).\n\n## Discussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the largest pharmacogenetic study of allopurinol–SCAR. In this study, we identified a strong association of the allele HLA-B*5801 with the susceptibility of allopurinol-induced HSS, SJS, and TEN in Han Chinese. In fact, the association is 100% in that the HLA-B allele B*5801 was present in all 51 patients with allopurinol-induced SCAR, with an odds ratio exceeding that reported for the association between HLA-B27 and ankylosing spondylitis ([20](#ref20), [21](#ref21)). Although other ethnic allopurinol–SCAR patients were not available for our study, the fact that HLA-B*5801 allele is also present in other populations (7% in Africa, ≈2–7% in Caucasian, and 8% in Asian Indian) ([22](#ref22)) suggests that this association may also exist in other ethnic groups. However, as pharmacogenetic results can vary by the study populations, it remains to be seen to what extent this study applies to other populations.\n\nA relation between allopurinol–SCAR and decreased creatinine clearance has been documented, and adjusting the dose of allopurinol based on the creatinine clearance has been proposed ([23](#ref23)). Our data showed that patients with chronic renal insufficiency had an increased risk for allopurinol–SCAR (4.7-fold). The drug-accumulation hypothesis has been proposed to explain the association of renal insufficiency with allopurinol hypersensitivity ([5](#ref5)). However, adjusting allopurinol dosage has no significant effect on reducing allopurinol hypersensitivity ([24](#ref24)). Moreover, lowering dosage may lead to inefficient reduction of serum uric acid levels for effective control of gout ([25](#ref25)). Our data suggest that genotyping the B*5801 allele may provide a better guidance of avoiding allopurinol-induced SCAR in patients with renal insufficiency than dosage adjusting.\n\nAssociations of particular HLA alleles with adverse events have been reported in patients taking various drugs. For example, HLA-A29, B12, and DR7 were found more frequently in sulfonamide-induced SJS; A2 and B12 were found more frequently in NSAIDs-induced SJS ([26](#ref26), [27](#ref27)); HLA-B59 was found more frequently in SJS with ocular involvement ([28](#ref28)); and HLA-AW33 and -B17/BW58 were found more frequently in allopurinol drug eruption ([29](#ref29)). However, none of the associations have a sufficiently high predictive value that can be clinically useful for screening before drugs are prescribed. The weak associations in the previous studies could be due to differences in patient ascertainment and/or lack of a precise genotyping method for HLA allele subtypes at that time.\n\nWe have recently reported a strong association of a specific HLA-B allele (B*1502) in carbamazepine induced SJS ([30](#ref30)). Hypersensitivity to abacavir, a drug for AIDS, was reported to be associated with another HLA-B allele (B*5701) and a haplotypic Hsp70-Hom variant in the MHC region ([31](#ref31), [32](#ref32)). This study, together with the previous reports, suggests that HLA-B alleles and/or other genetic polymorphisms in the MHC region might play a major role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated SCAR. A specific HLA-B molecule may function as antigenic presentation of certain drug or its metabolite for HLA restricted T cell activation. Further studies along these lines may increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of these potentially life-threatening clinical conditions.\n\nAlthough all allopurinol–SCAR patients in our study carried at least one HLA-B*5801 allele, there were tolerant patients who also carried the allele. This finding suggests that HLA-B*5801 is necessary but not sufficient for allopurinol–SCAR. There could be other cofactors, such as renal insufficiency or virus infection, which have been implicated to be risk factors for the development of allopurinol–SCAR ([5](#ref5), [33](#ref33)). Our findings provided the evidence that renal insufficiency is indeed a risk factor for allopurinol–SCAR. Furthermore, other genes may also be involved in the mechanism of pathogenesis, such as costimulatory molecules involved in the interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T cell interaction. The present study revealed that CFLAR, an apoptosis regulator, could also be involved in allopurinol–SCAR ([34](#ref34)–[36](#ref36)).\n\nIn summary, we have shown that allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions are associated with a strong genetic predisposition. Genetic polymorphisms in the MHC region, particularly the HLA-B*5801 allele, is highly associated with individuals who are at risk for allopurinol-induced HSS, SJS, or TEN.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis research project was supported by grants from the National Science and Technology Program for Genomic Medicine, National Science Council, Taiwan (National Clinical Core and National Genotyping Core), and the Genomics and Proteomics Program, Academia Sinica.\n\n## Associated Data\n\n*This section collects any data citations, data availability statements, or supplementary materials included in this article.*\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n## References\n\n1.

Nevirapine (NVP), is an HIV-1 antiretroviral with treatment-limiting hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) associated with multiple class I and II HLA alleles. Here we utilize a novel analytical approach to explore these multi-allelic associations by systematically examining HLA molecules for similarities in peptide binding specificities and binding pocket structure. We demonstrate that primary predisposition to cutaneous NVP HSR, seen across ancestral groups, can be attributed to a cluster of HLA-C alleles sharing a common binding groove F pocket with HLA-C*04:01. An independent association with a group of class II alleles which share the HLA-DRB1-P4 pocket is also observed. In contrast, NVP HSR protection is afforded by a cluster of HLA-B alleles defined by a characteristic peptide binding groove B pocket. The results suggest drug-specific interactions within the antigen binding cleft can be shared across HLA molecules with similar binding pockets. We thereby provide an explanation for multiple HLA associations with cutaneous NVP HSR and advance insight into its pathogenic mechanisms.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAdverse drug reactions are associated with considerable global morbidity and mortality and pose a substantial challenge in drug development and implementation. A subset of these reactions are T-cell mediated and associate with particular class I and/or class II human leukocyte antigen (*HLA*) alleles, which govern presentation of peptides for recognition by the T-cell receptor (TCR).\n\nThe peptide binding grooves of both class I and class II HLA molecules are formed by a β-sheet floor consisting of eight anti-parallel β-sheets, packed against two anti-parallel α-helices forming a channel^1^. In class I molecules (HLA-A, -B, and -C) the binding groove is divided into six pockets, A-F, which are defined by specific polymorphic amino acid residues that determine their topography and functionality^2–6^. These class I HLA molecules typically bind peptides 8–11 amino acids in length. Structures of peptide/HLA complexes show that conserved hydrogen bonds are formed between HLA side chains and the peptide backbone of the nine core amino acids within the bound peptide^7^. Additional HLA allele specific interactions are formed between the peptide side chains and structural pockets in the antigen binding cleft. Compared to class I, the class II HLA-DRB1 molecules bind longer peptides of variable length (i.e. 12–15 amino acids). The most polymorphic HLA-DRB1 elements are the structural pockets that accommodate peptide positions 1 (P1), P4, P6, P7 and P9^7^.\n\nThe allelic specificity of the HLA peptide binding groove in the pathogenesis of T cell mediated drug hypersensitivity is exemplified by the well characterized abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome which occurs both *in vivo* and *in vitro* only in association with *HLA-B*57:01*, and not with related B17 serotype alleles such as *HLA-B*57:02*/3 and *HLA-B*58:01*. It is well established that patients carrying these related alleles tolerate abacavir and *in vitro* functional assays are negative. This illustrates the importance of allele-specific sites within the HLA peptide binding groove, where single amino acid changes seen between risk and control alleles can alter the chemistry of HLA-drug interaction. Abacavir binds directly to a unique combination of polymorphic residues within the F pocket of the HLA binding groove present only in HLA-B*57:01 and not in other B17 serotype alleles^8, 9^. This results in presentation of self-peptides not previously exposed to patient T cells as neoantigens^8–10^. Dependence on the structure of the antigen binding groove for determining HLA allelic risk has also been demonstrated for other drug hypersensitivity syndromes^11–15^.\n\nNevirapine (NVP) is antiretroviral active against HIV-1, which is generally well tolerated without central nervous system, metabolic or renal toxicities. However, treatment-limiting drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) affect approximately 5% of patients who initiate nevirapine and this has impacted use of the drug globally. These HSRs are also noted in patients treated with NVP for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis^16, 17^. NVP hypersensitivity encompasses different clinical phenotypes with cutaneous, hepatic or systemic symptoms^18^. The different HSR phenotypes are associated with both shared and specific class I and class II HLA alleles, which have variable distribution and risk across ethnic groups^19–21^. Cutaneous reactions range in severity from mild rash through to severe diseases with high morbidity and mortality such as Stevens Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which is characterized by a combination of fever, rash and/or hepatitis and/or eosinophilia^19^. The HLA alleles most often associated with cutaneous manifestations of NVP HSR are *HLA-C*04*, commonly carried across ethnicities, as well as *HLA-B*35* in Asians and Caucasian patients^19, 21–24^.\n\nIn this work we consider how HLA allelic groupings based on similarities in peptide binding specificity and structure of the HLA binding groove may explain observed diversity of HLA associations with the severe cutaneous phenotype of NVP HSR (grade 3 or 4 rash). Validated supertypes, which group alleles based on peptide binding data and pocket chemistry^4, 5, 25^, are examined, together with class I and II allele clusters defined by similarities in pocket structure of the peptide-binding groove^4, 5, 25^. This approach has identified key HLA loci specific positions within the binding groove associated with cutaneous NVP HSR and several novel risk and protective HLA alleles for the development of the syndrome.\n\n## Results\n\n### Cutaneous NVP HSR associates with HLA-C alleles having similar peptide binding properties and F pocket structure as HLA-C*04:01\n\nFour digit HLA typing was available for 151 cases and 413 controls. In single allele logistic regression analyses *HLA-C*04:01* was the only allele for which a consistent, significant predisposing relationship for cutaneous manifestations of NVP HSR was observed across all ancestral groups (Odds ratio (OR) = 3.06 and *P* = 0.0001 in whole cohort analysis, (Fig. [1A](#Fig1)); Asian: OR = 5.49, *P* = 0.0001; Caucasian: OR = 2.08, *P* = 0.02; and African: OR = 3.84, *P* = 0.04). However, analyses specific to ancestral groups also revealed several other *HLA-C* allelic associations indicative of HSR predisposition, namely *HLA-C*05:01* in Caucasians (versus non-*HLA-C*05:01* carriers: OR = 2.84, *P* = 0.002) and *HLA-C*18:01* in patients with African ancestry (versus non-*HLA-C*18:01* carriers: OR = 2.67, *P* = 0.2; vs non-*HLA-C*04:01*/*-C*18:01* carriers: OR = 4.71, *P* = 0.06).\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e18d/5561238/6f1b06125eca/41598_2017_8876_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nHLA-C alleles with shared F pocket and binding properties associate with cutaneous NVP HSR.

(D) Molecular docking model showing preferred locations of NVP bound to the peptide binding groove of HLA-C*04:01 within the B or F pocket as determined by positional scanning analysis. (E) Alignment of representative HLA-C B pocket sequences and position 156. Yellow highlighted positions show amino acids that are variable amongst the cohort alleles and conserved within the HLA-C risk group for cutaneous NVP HSR. NVP HSR risk alleles from this analysis with a common F pocket are shown in bold font. All other HLA-C alleles from the cohort with n > 5 are not shown and carry the HLA-B pocket common to risk alleles except at 9-Y(Tyr), 99-Y(Tyr), and 156 L/W/Q (Leu/Trp/Gln).\n\nSimilarities between binding specificities for the identified *HLA-C* risk alleles (*HLA-C*04:01*, *-*05:01* and *-*18:01*) were examined with *MHCcluster* (which groups HLA molecules according to their peptide-binding specificity^26, 27^) and according to their characteristic motif across pockets (A-F) of the HLA-C peptide-binding groove^3–6^. Respective consideration of pocket composition characterised a subset of HLA-C risk alleles^3–6^. For every pocket, the characteristic *HLA-C*04:01* motif demonstrated greatest impact on development of cutaneous NVP HSR (Fig. [1B](#Fig1)), with the greatest significance attributable to the F pocket^4^, where commonality of the residues Asp74-Asn77-Lys80-Leu81-Tyr84-Leu95-Arg97-Asn114-Phe116-Tyr123-Trp133-Thr143-Lys146-Trp147 grouped risk alleles *HLA-C*05:01* and *HLA-C*18:01* with *HLA-C*04:01* in a cluster that also included *HLA-C*-04:03* and -*04:06* (Fig. [1C](#Fig1)). Other HLA-C alleles with similarities in peptide binding preference predicted by *MHCcluster* differed at several F pocket positions (*HLA-C*17:01*, *-C*08:*02, *-C*14:02*, -*C*07:01*/*02*/04, *-C*06:02*) (Fig. [1C](#Fig1), Figure [S1](#MOESM1)). Characterization of other HLA binding pockets A-E by key amino acid residues failed to group the primary *HLA-C* risk HSR alleles together, or conversely included additional alleles that weakened the associated effect. Moreover, the heightened risk of cutaneous NVP HSR conferred by the *HLA-C*04:01* cluster could not simply be attributed to greater surface expression levels for the risk alleles. A modest univariable association with HLA-C expression imputed from published MFI coefficients^28–30^ was abrogated in an analysis that jointly considered carriage of an allele belonging to the predisposing *HLA-C* cluster (expression level: *P* > 0.2; risk HLA-C allele: *P* = 0.0001), although we note relative size of observed risk effects reflect the ordering of imputed expression levels^28–30^ (MFI expression units: *C*05:01* = 154 < *C*04:01* = 199 < *C*18:01* = 239; multivariable OR[95% CI]: *C*05:01*/09 = 2.2[1.2–3.9] < *C*04:01*/03/06 = 2.5[1.6–3.9] < *C*18:01* = 2.6[0.6–11.1]).\n\nSince *HLA-C* risk alleles share F pocket residues we hypothesized that a common direct interaction between the F pocket of the antigen-binding cleft and drug/peptide may drive a common predisposition to cutaneous NVP HSR. Molecular docking and positional scanning was utilised to predict potential interactions between NVP with the antigen binding cleft using the crystal structure of *HLA-C*04:01* ^31^ and the most likely positions for NVP to bind to HLA-C*04:01 is either within the B pocket, close to position 99 of the binding groove or within the F pocket (Fig. [1D](#Fig1), Table [S1](#MOESM1)). This agrees with an independent analysis by *Carr et al*.^32^ Not all identified HLA-C risk alleles carry Phe99, the exception being *HLA-C*05:*01 which carries Tyr99 and other B pocket residues in common with non-risk alleles (Fig. [1E](#Fig1)). However, position Arg156 of the binding groove was also shared by risk alleles (Fig. [1E](#Fig1), Figure [S2](#MOESM1)) and this position is important in HLA-C*04:01 crystal structure with peptide (QY**D**DAVYKL), providing stability to the **D** at P3 of the bound peptide, enabling P3 to act as an alternative N terminal anchor residue^31^. Therefore, the observed association of F pocket residues with cutaneous NVP HSR are consistent with modelling data that suggest this may be a preferred docking site for NVP within the HLA-C peptide binding groove. In addition, the position Arg156 shared by all risk alleles may be important in providing stability to the bound peptide in the presence of NVP.\n\n### Secondary associations with cutaneous NVP HSR attributable to HLA class I binding pocket structure\n\nHaving established that *HLA-C* alleles sharing the HLA-C*04:01 F pocket^4^ have a primary predisposing impact on development of cutaneous NVP HSR, we next sought to elucidate the role of secondary HLA class I and class II effects. We similarly considered peptide binding properties and structure of pockets A-F of the class I loci HLA-A, -B and -C and pockets P1, P4, P6, P7 and P9 of class II HLA-DRB1 within the peptide binding groove^2–7, 33^. P-value plots of the most significant characteristic motif associated with each pocket demonstrate that little effect could be attributed to HLA-A, and the most prominent secondary effect is protection associated with the HLA-B B pocket, which is independent of HLA-C risk (OR = 0.18, p = 0.0001 and OR = 0.20, p = 0.0003 for models with and without adjustment for the primary HLA-C cluster) (Fig. [2A](#Fig2)). The B pocket^4, 5^ motif Tyr7-Tyr9-Ala24-Val34-(Met/Thr)45-Glu63-Ile66-Ser67-Asn70-(Tyr/Phe)99 is characteristic of a cluster of HLA-B B62 supertype alleles: *HLA-B*15:*(*01*/12/24/25/27/35) and *HLA-B*52:*01 (Figure [S3](#MOESM1) and Table [S2](#MOESM1)), consistent with a previously reported protective *HLA-B*15* association with cutaneous NVP reactions observed in an Indian population^34^. However, in this dataset the strength of the protection is diminished when the HLA B62 supertype as a whole is considered or if *HLA-B*52:01* is excluded (Table [1](#Tab1)). It appears that the protective property of this HLA B62 sub-group is driven by the common B pocket structure of the binding groove. Other HLA B62 supertype alleles (HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*46:01) differ from protective alleles at one or more key B pocket positions; Glu63, Ile66, Ser67 or Asn70 (Table [S2](#MOESM1)). Crystallography studies of *HLA-B*15:01* structure show a hydrophobic B pocket^35^, and molecular docking of NVP against the protective *HLA-B* alleles provides support for the binding of NVP to this hydrophobic B pocket of the HLA-B peptide binding groove (Fig. [2B](#Fig2)).\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e18d/5561238/a21aeb1f653d/41598_2017_8876_Fig2_HTML.jpg)\n\nPrincipal associations with cutaneous NVP HSR across each pocket of the peptide binding groove for HLA-A, -B,-C and -DRB1. (A) Results show the P-value for the characteristic motif having greatest association with cutaneous NVP HSR in ethnicity-adjusted logistic regression analyses with and without additional adjustment for co-carriage of the HLA-C risk F pocket.

Molecular docking predicts that NVP interacts with a structural B pocket largely shared by HLA-B B62 supertype molecules, as indicated with a blue line.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n|   | Supertype | Adjusted for race only |  |  | Adjusted for race and predisposing C*0401 cluster |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OR | [95% CI] | P | OR | [95% CI] | P |  |  |\n|   | B07 | 1.75 | [1.19–2.58] | 0.004 | 1.64 | [1.11–2.44] | 0.01 |\n|   | B08 | 0.98 | [0.48–2.00] | >0.9 | 1.39 | [0.67–2.92] | 0.4 |\n|   | B27 | 1.00 | [0.63–1.58] | >0.9 | 1.07 | [0.67–1.72] | 0.8 |\n|   | B44 | 1.02 | [0.69–1.51] | 0.9 | 0.92 | [0.61–1.38] | 0.7 |\n|   | B58 | 0.68 | [0.39–1.18] | 0.2 | 0.68 | [0.39–1.19] | 0.2 |\n|   | B62 | 0.47 | [0.28–0.79] | 0.004 | 0.49 | [0.29–0.83] | 0.009 |\n| Principal supertype | MHCCluster | OR | [95% CI] | P | OR | [95% CI] | P |\n| B07 | B*07 | 0.53 | [0.26–1.06] | 0.07 | 0.69 | [0.34–1.41] | 0.3 |\n| B07 | B*35; *53 | 2.09 | [1.28–3.41] | 0.003 | 1.25 | [0.73–2.16] | 0.4 |\n| B07 | B*51; *54; *55; *56 | 1.66 | [1.05–2.63] | 0.03 | 2.09 | [1.29–3.39] | 0.003 |\n| B08 | B*08 | 0.98 | [0.48–2.00] | >0.9 | 1.39 | [0.67–2.92] | 0.4 |\n| B27 | B*14 | 0.65 | [0.27–1.57] | 0.3 | 0.64 | [0.26–1.57] | 0.3 |\n| B27 | B*38; *39 | 1.50 | [0.86–2.61] | 0.2 | 1.82 | [1.02–3.22] | 0.04 |\n| B58 | B*57; *58 | 0.79 | [0.45–1.39] | 0.4 | 0.78 | [0.44–1.39] | 0.4 |\n| B62 | B*46 | 0.98 | [0.49–1.94] | >0.9 | 1.12 | [0.56–2.25] | 0.7 |\n| B62 | B*15 | 0.43 | [0.25–0.74] | 0.002 | 0.40 | [0.23–0.70] | 0.001 |\n| B44 | B*37; *40; *45; *50 | 0.60 | [0.36–1.01] | 0.05 | 0.67 | [0.39–1.13] | 0.1 |\n| B44 | B*18; *44 | 1.54 | [0.97–2.43] | 0.07 | 1.16 | [0.72–1.89] | 0.5 |\n| B62 | B*52 | 0.19 | [0.03–1.48] | 0.1 | 0.22 | [0.03–1.73] | 0.2 |\n| Unclassified | B*13 | 1.15 | [0.64–2.07] | 0.6 | 1.12 | [0.62–2.05] | 0.7 |\n| B27 | B*27 | 0.69 | [0.27–1.73] | 0.4 | 0.68 | [0.27–1.74] | 0.4 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: HLA-B supertype and MHCcluster (2 digit) group associations with NVP HSR rash.\n\nThe most prominent HLA-B motif associated with risk for cutaneous NVP HSR was the E pocket sequence Ser97-Asp114-Trp147-Val152-Leu156 uniquely carried by *HLA-B*35:05* (Fig. [2A](#Fig2), Table [S3](#MOESM1)). Notably, all other *HLA-B*35* alleles lack the Ser97 residue and significant predisposition did not extend to the *HLA-B*35* allelic group considered as a whole (Table [1](#Tab1)). In this cohort, haplotypic *HLA-C*04:01* is carried with *HLA-B*35:05* in 9 of 10 Southeast Asian cutaneous NVP HSR cases so it is possible that the alleles may act synergistically. Other secondary HLA-B risk alleles were identified by analysis of supertypes in combination with *MHCcluster* designated peptide binding specificities after adjusting for the effect of the *HLA-C*04:01* risk allele group (Figure [S3](#MOESM1), Table [1](#Tab1)). These included *HLA-B*51*/*-B*54*/*-B*55*/*-B*56* from the supertype B07 and *HLA-B*38*/*-B*39* from supertype B27. While there was no single common HLA binding pocket motif that characterised the *HLA-B* B07 and B27 supertype risk alleles, the *HLA-B*38*/*-B*39* group was characterised by the E/F pocket sequence Leu95-Arg97-Asn114-(Phe/Lys)116-Val152-Leu156 and the B07 HLA-B risk alleles by the sequence Trp95-Thr97-Asn114-(Phe/Leu/Tyr)116-(Val/Glu)152-Leu156 (Table [S3](#MOESM1)).\n\n### Secondary associations with cutaneous NVP HSR attributable to HLA class II, P4 binding pocket\n\nFrom *MHCcluster* (Figure [S4](#MOESM1)) and binding groove analyses of the *HLA-DRB1* alleles within the cohort we identified a cluster including both supertype HLA-DR1 and -DR4 alleles (HLA-*DRB1*01:*(*01*/02/03) and *-DRB1**04*:*(*04*/05/08/10), respectively) that exhibited a secondary association with cutaneous NVP HSR (Fig. [2A](#Fig2)). *HLA-DRB1*01:01* and *HLA–DRB1*01:0*2 have previously been associated with hepatic hypersensitivity to NVP^36, 37^. The identified risk alleles for cutaneous NVP HSR share the sequence (Phe/His)13-Gln70-Arg71-Ala74-Tyr78 over residues forming the P4 pocket (Table [S4](#MOESM1)). In contrast, the predominantly Caucasian alleles *HLA-DRB1*04:01* and -*DRB1*04:15* differed from the risk group only at position β71 within the P4 pocket, and yet appeared to be protective in this ancestral group (2 cases, 26 controls, p = 0.01). This suggests that β71, which is key in dictating the nature of the peptide amino acid that is accommodated in the P4 pocket of the antigen binding groove, is of particular importance in NVP HSR. The β71 position within the P4 pocket of HLA-DRB1 has previously been implicated in the pathology of several autoimmune diseases including Graves disease, type I diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis^38–42^.\n\nElution studies utilising L2 cell lines that stably express the NVP HSR risk allele *HLA–DRB1*01:01* were conducted to assess if presence of the drug may affect the repertoire of peptides that bind to HLA-DRB1*01:01. For *HLA-DRB1*01:01*, 605 peptides were eluted in the untreated cells and 359 from the NVP treated cells. Peptides in the unique +/− NVP elution sets (untreated: N = 305; treated: N = 64) were of similar length (mean (sd) treated = 14.6 (2.6); untreated = 15.0 (2.8)), and the comparison of their core 9mers as predicted using *NETMHCIIpan version* 2.*2* showed very similar distributions for anchoring amino acids at P1 and P9 (Figure [S5](#MOESM1)). Apparent small differences in the frequency of some amino acids at P4 and P6 did not reach statistical significance with adjustment for multiple comparisons. Finally, all peptides from the NVP treated sample (>12 mer) were examined for differences in binding affinity in the presence and absence of the drug in functional assays. No difference in binding to HLA-DRB1*01:01 was observed.\n\nMolecular modelling and docking scores were used to investigate whether NVP is likely to be accommodated by the *HLA-DRB1**01*:01* antigen binding cleft in the presence of peptide utilising the sequence logo for peptides eluted in the absence and presence of NVP (Figures [S5](#MOESM1) and [S6](#MOESM1)). Both models predicted weak binding scores (−6.1 kcal/mol) and suggested that NVP is unlikely to bind directly to HLA-DRB1*01:01 in the presence of peptide (Figure [S6](#MOESM1)). In all, this data provides little support for NVP having a significant effect on the binding of peptides to *HLA-DRB1*01:01*.\n\n### Overall model and risk assessment for cutaneous NVP HSR\n\nMultivariate modelling was used to examine overall risk for cutaneous NVP HSR associated with the identified predisposing and protective clusters in both whole-cohort and ancestry-specific analyses. The cluster effects remain strong when the models additionally account for the independent impact of NVP metabolism as conferred by *CYP2B6* genotype, noted previously in this cohort^21^ (Table [2](#Tab2)). Moreover, striking similarities in observed relative odds are evident across the ancestral groups (Fig. [3](#Fig3)), despite varying allele frequency distributions (Fig. [4](#Fig4)). Risk *HLA-B* and *HLA-DRB1* alleles are shared across several *HLA-C* allele groups in addition to the *HLA-C*04:01* F pocket risk group and there is little support for any dominant haplotypic effect in cutaneous NVP HSR risk with the exception of *HLA-B*35:05* carried with *HLA-C*04:01* in Asians which display strong linkage disequilibrium.\n\n### Table 2.\n\n|   | ALL OR [95% CI] | Caucasian OR [95% CI] | Asian OR [95% CI] | African OR [95% CI] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| HLA-C*04:01 | 4.06 [2.39–6.88] | 3.14 [1.49–6.62] | 7.30 [2.74–19.5] | 5.60 [1.22–25.75] |\n| Other risk F pocket (DNKLYLRNFYWTKW) HLA-C*04:(03/06/07), -C*05:(01/09), -C*18:01 | 2.91 [1.62–5.23] | 3.92 [1.74–8.86] | 1.64 [0.53–5.12] | 3.18 [0.53–19.04] |\n| Risk B07 alleles HLA-B*35:05, -B*39:10, -B*51:(01/02), -B*54:01, HLA-B*55:(01/02), -B*56:(01/04), -B*67:01, HLA-B*78:01 | 2.32 [1.42–3.79] | 2.27 [1.06–4.85] | 2.19 [1.10–4.35] | 2.93 [0.23–37.10] |\n| Risk non-B07 HLA-B alleles HLA-B*13:02, B*38:(01/02), -B*39:(01/05/06/09), B*51:07 | 1.76 [1.02–3.02] | 1.87 [0.76–4.57] | 1.50 [0.72–3.12] | 5.54 [0.30–101.20] |\n| Protective HLA-B alleles HLA-B*15:(01/12/24/25/27/32/35), -B*52:01 | 0.18 [0.07–0.46] | 0.25 [0.06–1.15] | 0.18 [0.05–0.61] |   |\n| Risk HLA-DRB1 alleles HLA-DRB1*01:(01/02/03), -DRB1*04:(04/05/08/10) | 2.00 [1.23–3.24] | 1.34 [0.68–2.64] | 3.23 [1.40–7.43] | 4.77 [0.95–24.04] |\n| Slow CYP2B6 metabolizer | 2.07 [1.12–3.82] | 3.19 [1.04–9.78] | 1.66 [0.64–4.32] | 1.81 [0.45–7.33] |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Multivariate logistic regression model of predisposition to cutaneous NVP HSR, according to ancestry.\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n![Figure 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e18d/5561238/b1bce4d12594/41598_2017_8876_Fig3_HTML.jpg)\n\nRelative effects of predisposing and protective HLA clusters on cutaneous NVP HSR risk.

Here, utilization of high resolution typing for the cohort of HIV-1-infected patients in this study was combined with a detailed analysis of peptide binding groove properties. The analyses revealed that, despite marked variation in the observed HLA allele repertoire across the representative ethnicities, the alleles associated with cutaneous NVP HSR share the structure of specific binding pockets within the antigen-binding groove. Consideration of binding pocket structure has previously been useful for the identification of key HLA molecule risk positions in the pathology of several autoimmune diseases with HLA class I and class II allele associations as well as HIV-1 disease progression^41, 43–45^. While certain drug HSR syndromes show clear associations with only one specific allele, such as abacavir with *HLA-B*57:01*, such single allele associations with 100% negative predictive values are the exception rather than the rule; hence the approach described provides a potential means for exploring more complex drug HSRs or immune-based pathologies with multiple risk HLA alleles such as is observed for cutaneous NVP HSR.\n\n### HLA class I risk allele model\n\nBoth *HLA-C*04* and *HLA-B*35* have been linked with cutaneous NVP HSR symptoms of varying severity in other studies^19, 21, 22, 46–48^, but with *HLA-B*35*/*-C*04* carried as a common haplotype it has been difficult to disentangle the relative contributions of the individual alleles. Our data suggest that *HLA-B*35:05* and *HLA-C*04:01* may have a synergistic effect in South East Asians, but any apparent predisposition conferred by other *HLA-B*35* alleles is abrogated when co-carriage of a risk *HLA-C* allele is considered. Moreover, here we demonstrate that the observed association with *HLA-C*04* across ethnicities is primarily driven by the unique F pocket motif that *HLA-C*04:01* shares with *HLA-C*05:01* and *HLA-C*18:01* which have dominant effects observed in the Hispanic and African subgroups, respectively. By focussing on an underlying biological model, this targeted analysis has therefore enabled both the confirmation of previous findings and identification of novel, less common, alleles that may be missed in exploratory analyses which require multiple comparisons to be appropriately accommodated.\n\nExamination of the crystal structure of HLA-C*04:01 complexed with a nonameric consensus peptide (QYDDAVYKL)^31^ yields some insight into a possible mechanism for heightened predisposition to NVP HSR. The solved structure shows that Arg156, which is characteristic of all the observed HLA-C risk alleles, forms stabilising hydrogen bonds with the central portion of the peptide (QY**D**D**AV**YKL). Our docking models indicate the F pocket is a preferred binding site for NVP to interact directly with the binding groove of HLA-C. Our data therefore supports a model of cutaneous NVP HSR whereby the chemistry of the F pocket in the antigen-binding groove of the primary *HLA-C* risk molecules enables binding of NVP in the same area as the C-terminal binding of disease causing peptide ligands presented to pathogenic T cells. We propose that these peptides are anchored in the F pocket together with NVP, and hence the central portion of the peptide (P3-P5-P6) is stabilised by Arg156, and when presented together with NVP, propagate T-cell mediated responses in NVP HSR individuals. This is in keeping with other models of drug hypersensitivity, such as abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome where both drug and peptide are able to occupy the peptide binding groove of HLA-B*57:01^8, 9^. Furthermore, our proposed model is consistent with mitigation of risk being associated with diminished cell surface expression of predisposing HLA molecules, with risk HLA-C alleles being amongst the more highly expressed HLA-C molecules. Similarly, protection afforded by the protective HLA-B*15:01/-B*52:01 cluster could be explained by dominance of the more highly expressed HLA-B molecules. In the case of protective HLA-B alleles the particular HLA-B-drug—peptide combination may mimic a self-peptide-HLA combination that is tolerated by the host.\n\n### HLA-DRB1 risk allele model\n\nA HLA-DRB1 P4 pocket of the peptide binding groove common to the alleles HLA-*DRB1*01:*(*01*/02/03) and *-DRB1**04*:*(*04*/05/08/10) shows a significant secondary association with cutaneous NVP HSR. Despite this, peptide elution and binding studies with a cells expressing *HLA-DRB1*01:01* together with molecular modelling did not show evidence of NVP binding to HLA-DRB1*01:01 in the presence of peptide, or any influence of NVP on the repertoire of peptides presented by HLA-DRB1*01:01. It is possible that NVP has off-target or tissue specific effects on peptides *in vivo* that are not detected in the *HLA-DRB1*01:01* elutions, or that the drug directly impacts TCR binding.\n\nThe P4 pocket of *HLA-DRB1*01:01* and other *HLA-DRB1* risk alleles that are associated with cutaneous NVP HSR differ from the protective alleles *HLA-DRB1*04:01* and *-DRB1*04:15* by a single amino acid residue β71, where R(Arg) is present in risk alleles and K(Lys) is protective. Previous crystal structures for HLA-DRB1*01:01 and -DRB1*04:01 bound to TCR (HA1.7) and peptide (HA antigen from influenza A virus), have shown that K(Lys)71 has a shorter side chain and pulls the bound peptide further into the HLA groove compared to the longer sidechain of R(Arg)71 that binds the peptide to the groove in more horizontal orientation^49^. In this model, cross-reactive TCR are able to tolerate these differences, while other specific TCRs are sensitive to such differences. A similar effect on peptide orientation for positon β71 is observed in HLA-DRB1*15:01^50^. Therefore, β71 in the base of the HLA-DRB1 binding groove P4 pocket, which is significant in cutaneous NVP HSR, influences T cell recognition through its impact on the peptide preference and orientation^50–52^. Similarly in several autoimmune conditions including Graves’ disease, type I diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, the P4 pocket positions 13, 70 and 71 separate risk and protective *HLA-DRB1* alleles^38–42, 53, 54^.\n\n### Additional risk factors\n\nThe risk HLA alleles identified in this study appear to be required for the development of cutaneous NVP HSR, however, similar to the HLA associations with other drugs, not all individuals with the risk alleles develop hypersensitivity to NVP and additional factors also contribute to this “positive predictive value gap” (Fig. [4](#Fig4)). For example, slow metabolizer genotypes for *CYP2B6* (516 G → T and 983 T → C) have previously been shown to correlate with both increased plasma levels of NVP and increased risk for class I HLA restricted cutaneous NVP HSR^54–56^. Alternative drug metabolism pathways may also impact predisposition to NVP HSR, such as other CYP enzymes (*CYP3A4*, *CYP2D6*, *CYP2C19 and CYP2A6*), which contribute to formation of the 12-sulfoxyl-NVP metabolite^57^ which binds selectively to histidine and cysteine residues in proteins *in vitro*. The same adducts are detected in human serum albumin isolated from the blood of NVP-treated patients^58^ as are adducts of hemoglobin with modified N -terminal valine residues^59^. This suggests pro-haptenation as another potential mechanism for HLA specific associations with hypersensitivity to NVP and may explain in part, why no shift in peptide repertoire is seen in elution studies with HLA-DRB1*01:01 cell lines after NVP treatment *in-vitro*. Additional factors that contribute to T-cell recognition of foreign antigens such as tissue and individual variation in peptides, alternative peptide processing pathways or the available TCR repertoire of an individual may also contribute to the development of and specific clinical phenotype of NVP hypersensitivity for individuals with risk HLA alleles.\n\nIn summary, this study has considered how peptide binding chemistry of the HLA antigen binding groove impacts cutaneous NVP HSR and has identified the unique F pocket conformation that defines a primary risk cluster of *HLA-C* alleles. The secondary protective and risk effects also identified in *HLA-B* and *HLA-DRB1* highlight the complexity of this particular drug HSR. Our findings suggest possible models of cutaneous NVP HSR and reveal key HLA alleles in NVP HSR risk and protection. These insights can be utilized to further investigate the nature of the bound peptide in the presence or absence of NVP and the T cell response to drug. The novel approach presented here is likely to prove useful for the study of complex HLA associations in other drug HSR syndromes and autoimmune conditions.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Patient Samples\n\nData and specimens used for this study were from a case-control analysis of NVP HSR (ClinicalTrials.gov; [NCT00310843](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00310843)) where IRB approval had been obtained for HLA typing and the samples had previously been examined for low-resolution (two digit) HLA associations with NVP hypersensitivity^21^. The present study focused on high-resolution (four digit) typing using deep sequencing technologies. Ethics approval for this study was provided by Vanderbilt University (IRB#111684) and Murdoch University (HREC#2012/163). All methods were performed in accordance with the Australian National Health and Medical research Council (NHMRC) “*National Statement on ethical conduct in human research 2007”*.\n\n### Patient Inclusion/Exclusion criteria\n\nCases (N = 151) and controls (N = 413) were at least 18 years of age, HIV-1-infected, and had previously initiated NVP-containing therapy. Cases had experienced severe cutaneous toxicity (grade 3 or 4) categorized by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Division of AIDS criteria. Potential cases and controls were excluded for: fewer than 150 CD4 T cells/μl within six months before initiating NVP or use of immunomodulatory medications within the first eight weeks of NVP therapy. Potential controls were excluded for: development of grade ≥1 rash within 18 weeks of initiating nevirapine or any cutaneous condition potentially attributable to nevirapine; or any systemic reaction (e.g. flu-like symptoms, arthralgia, myalgia, or conjunctivitis) attributable to nevirapine during the first 18 weeks of treatment. Further case/control specific exclusion criteria are described in the original study^19^. All participants provided written informed consent.\n\nIn this analysis, clinical notes were re-assessed independently and only cases having a primary cutaneous phenotype were included. This analysis was restricted to individuals of five distinct self-reported ethnicities and Asian, African or Caucasian ancestry was ascribed accordingly (Asian: 54 cases/209 total South-East Asian and 11/48 Taiwanese; African: 19/63 African American; Caucasian: 42/158 European and 25/86 Hispanic). Samples from the original cohort were excluded in the re-analysis for the following reasons: no sample available for HLA typing, no clinical data, sample identity issues, or race/ethnicity other than described above.\n\n### HLA typing\n\nSpecific HLA loci were PCR amplified using sample specific MID-tagged primers that amplify polymorphic exons from HLA class I (-A, -B, -C exons 2 and 3) and class II (-DRB1, exon 2). Amplified DNA products from unique MID tagged products (up to 48 MIDs) were then pooled in equimolar ratios and subjected to library preparation, quantitation and emulsion PCR suitable for entry into the 454 FLX sequencing pipeline. Clonally enriched beads were used for 454 Titanium chemistry based sequencing on the 454 FLX+ sequencer. Sequences were then separated by MID tags and alleles called using an in-house accredited HLA allele caller software pipeline using the latest IMGT HLA allele database as the allele reference library.\n\n### Data Analysis\n\nLogistic regression analyses were undertaken to systematically examine differential effects on NVP HSR risk of HLA class I/II alleles and allele clusters based on HLA supertypes^4, 25^, binding pocket structure and peptide binding groups assigned from *MHCcluster* binding specificities^26, 27^. Both whole-cohort analyses and those restricted to ancestral groups were conducted and adjusted for ethnicity as appropriate. Odds ratios represent the estimated odds of HSR development amongst individuals carrying the designated allele/cluster relative to non-carriers (having all other demographic variables the same), and have been calculated as exponentiated model coefficients with the corresponding Wald confidence limits calculated similarly. P-values have also been derived from Wald tests of model coefficients.\n\nFirst pass class I HLA binding groove B and F pocket positions were as defined in Sidney *et al*.^4^. Further HLA class I analysis included binding pockets A and C-E^5^. E and F pocket positions are overlapping at positions 97, 114 and 147^4, 5^, thus for additional E/F pocket analysis all E and F pocket positions were included^4, 5^. HLA class II pockets were as previously defined^7^. Expected levels of HLA-C cell surface expression were calculated as the sum of two allelic median fluorescence intensity (MFI) coefficients among cases and controls as previously assigned^28–30^.\n\n### Molecular docking\n\nThe crystal structure of HLA molecules (HLA-C*04:01 (Protein Data Bank; PDB 1QQD); HLA-DRB1*01:01, (PDB 1FYT); HLA-B*15:01 (PDB 1XR8)) were utilised with AutoDock Vina for molecular docking predictions between NVP and the HLA alleles of interest. For modelling other HLA alleles, amino acid sequences were taken from IMGT HLA ([http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/allele.html](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/allele.html)). The HLA structures were generated based on the most similar solved structure in the PDB, using a swiss-model ([http://swissmodel.expasy.org/](http://swissmodel.expasy.org/)). DOCKER was used to align the HLA sequences (PILEUP, GCG Wisconsin Package), calculate sequence similarity based on a Blosum62 matrix, and output values for each protein position to correspond to atomic coordinates, which were plotted in 3-dimensions using PyMol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8 Schrödinger, LLC.).\n\n### Peptide Elutions using Single Antigen Lines\n\nLG2 cells homozygously expressing HLA-DRB1*01:01 were incubated with nevirapine (100 μg/mL) for 14 hr at 37 °C. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 hr and the supernatant was collected and passed through a 0.8/0.2 μm filter (VWR International, TX). The filtrate was collected and passed through a sepharose CL-4B (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) column, then passed through a column with protein A sepharose (PAS) beads (Sigma) coated with MK-D6.1 (MTCC HB-3, VA) antibody which served as an irrelevant antibody (specific for the mouse class II molecule, I-Ad) used to derive a negative control peptide extract. Next, the filtrate was passed through a second PAS column coated with L243 antibody (Biolegend) which captures HLA-DR molecules. The columns were washed and peptides eluted with 0.2 M glacial acetic acid. The eluted peptides were then collected and spun at 3,500 g at 4 °C until 98% of the solution had passed through Millipore ultrafiltration units with a 10 kDa cut-off (EMD Millipore, MA). The filtrate was then collected and vacuum-concentrated for subsequent LC-MS analysis.\n\n### Mass Spectrometry and Peptide analysis\n\nDried samples were brought up in 0.1% acetic acid and directly loaded onto an in-house, packed C18 column^55, 56^. Briefly, an irregular C18 (5–20 μm diameter) capillary precolumn (360 μm outer diameter, 75 μm inner diameter) was connected to a C18 (5 μm diameter) analytical capillary column (360 μm outer diameter, 50 μm inner diameter) equipped with an electrospray emitter tip. Peptides were eluted by a 90 min 0–60% B gradient (A: 0.1 M acetic acid; B: 70% ACN, 0.1 M acetic acid) using an Agilent 1100 HPLC at a flow rate of 60 nL/min. The RP-HPLC elution was electrospray-ionized into an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Data analysis was performed using Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific). Raw data files were searched against the RefSeq database using OMSSA^57^. MS2 searches used the following parameters: no enzyme specificity, e-value cutoff of 1, and a variable modification of methionine oxidation. Mass tolerances for intact and product ion masses were set at ± 0.1 Da and ± 0.35 Da, respectively. Additionally, MS2 data was searched using either c- and z·- fragments (ETD) or b-and y- fragments (CAD). All peptide hits were subject to manual interpretation of MS2 spectra.\n\n### MHC-Peptide Binding Assays\n\nAssays to quantitatively measure peptide binding to HLA-DRB1*01:01 (class II) MHC molecules are based on the inhibition of binding of a high affinity radiolabeled peptide to purified MHC molecules, and were performed essentially as described elsewhere^58, 59^. In brief, 0.1–1 nM of radiolabeled peptide was co-incubated at room temperature with 1 nM to 1 µM of purified HLA-DRB1*01:01 MHC in the presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors and 4 mg/mL of nevirapine in DMSO vs. DMSO alone, respectively. Following a two day incubation, MHC bound radioactivity was determined by capturing the MHC/peptide complexes on L243 (anti HLA-DR) antibody coated Lumitrac 600 plates (Greiner Bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany), and measuring bound cpm using the TopCount (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) microscintillation counter. In the case of competitive assays, the concentration of peptide yielding 50% inhibition of the binding of the radiolabeled peptide was calculated. Under the conditions utilized, where [label] < [MHC] and IC50 ≥ [MHC], the measured IC50 values are reasonable approximations of the true Kd values^60, 61^. Each competitor peptide was tested at six concentrations covering a 100,000-fold dose range. As a positive control, the unlabeled version of the radiolabeled probe was also tested in each experiment.\n\n### Data Availability\n\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n### URLS\n\nMHC cLuster NetMHCpan-2.8 ([http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MHCcluster/](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MHCcluster/)), NetMHCII Server ([http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCII/](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCII/)), IPD-IMGT/HLA ([https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/)), Protein Data bank (PDB) ([http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do)).\n\n## Electronic supplementary material\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work is supported in part by the following grants**:** Australian Centre for HIV and Hepatitis Virology Research (ACH2) - EoI 2013 [R.P., S.G., D.O., E.J.P.], EoI 2016 [S.B., R.P., A.R., S.G., E.J.P.]; Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) - APP1064524 [S.M., E.J.P.], APP1123499 [A.R., S.M., E.J.P.]; U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (NIH)/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 1R01AI103348-01 [D.O., S.M., E.J.P.], 5R01AI077505 [D.H.], UL1TR000445 [D.H.] P30AI110527 [S.M., E.J.P.], 5T32I007474 [S.M., E.J.P.], 5R01AI033993 [D.F.H.]; NIH/The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) 1P50GM115305 [E.J.P., S.M., D.K.]; NIH/National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) 1R13AR71267 [E.J.P.].\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nR.P., B.M., and E.P. conceptualized and conducted the data analysis, prepared figures and wrote the manuscript.

Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is a critical enzyme in irinotecan metabolism. The study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of irinotecan under the guidance of the pre-treatment UGT1A1 genotype in the second-line treatment of gastric cancer. Methods: This study involved 110 patients. Irinotecan was injected intravenously every 3 weeks, and the dose of irinotecan was determined by polymorphism of the UGT1A1 gene, which was divided into three groups (125 mg/m2: GG type; 100 mg/m2: GA type; 75 mg/m2: AA type). The primary end point was overall survival (OS), the secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Results: One hundred and seven patients received irinotecan treatment and three patients with AA type received paclitaxel treatment. Among 107 patients, there were no significant differences in PFS (4.8 m vs 4.9 m vs 4.4 m; p = 0.5249) and OS (9.3 m vs 9.3 m vs NA; p = 0.6821) among patients with GG/GA/AA subtypes after dose adjustment. For the patient with homozygosity mutation, treatment was switched to paclitaxel. There were no significant differences in PFS and OS among patients with different alleles or after dose adjustment (p > 0.05). There was a significant difference in the risk of delayed diarrhea (p = 0.000), leukopenia (p = 0.003) and neutropenia (p = 0.000) in patients with different UGT1A1*6 genotypes, while no difference in patients with different UGT1A1*28 genotypes. Additionally, grade 3/4 diarrhea, neutropenia, and leukopenia were significantly more common in AA genotype patients compared to GG (2%, 19%, 24%) or GA (23%, 31%, 31%) genotype patients. Conclusion: Individual irinotecan treatment shows encouraging survival and tolerability outcomes in patients with GG/GA subtype. Irinotecan may be not suitable for patients with AA subtype.\n\nKeywords: UGT1A1, irinotecan, gastric cancer, gene polymorphism, efficacy, toxicity\n\n## Introduction\n\nGastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common tumors of the digestive system. In 2020, it became the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fourth leading cause of cancer death.^ 1 ^ The incidence and death rates of GC vary by region, but more than 50% of cases occur in East Asia.^ 2 ^ In China, there were 478,508 new cases and 373,789 deaths, the third highest incidence and mortality rate followed by lung cancer and breast cancer. Due to the lack of typical symptoms in early GC, nearly two-thirds of the patients were diagnosed in the late stages of the disease, the 5-year survival rate is unsatisfactory.^ 3 ^\n\nSome phase III studies have shown a survival benefit from irinotecan or docetaxel as second-line chemotherapy.^4–6^ Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel also acted as a second-line treatment.^ 7 ^ Due to high cost of ramucirumab, only irinotecan or paclitaxel is the standard treatment for patients with metastatic GC in China. However, in clinical practice, irinotecan has often caused serious adverse events (AEs). The most common toxicity, neutropenia and delayed diarrhea limits its widespread use to some extent.^ 8 ^\n\nUridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (*UGT1A1*) is a polymorphic enzyme, which negatively correlates with gene transcription efficiency and total enzyme activity.^ 9 ^ The most common is *UGT1A1*28* and *UGT1A1*6* polymorphism.^ 10 ^ It has been suggested that *UGT1A1* gene polymorphisms can be used as an indicator to predict the risk of irinotecan adverse reactions.^11,12^ Multiple meta-analyses showed that the polymorphisms of *UGT1A1***6* and *UGT1A1***28* genes were significantly associated with irinotecan-induced severe diarrhea and neutropenia, but this conclusion is still controversial due to the different frequencies of *UGT1A1* genotypes in eastern and western countries.^13–16^\n\nIt is reported that *UGT1A1***6*, rather than *UGT1A1***28* is a predictor of irinotecan-induced toxicity in East Asia.^ 17 ^ In our center, it is observed that some patients displayed intolerable toxicity to standard dosing of irinotecan due to high incidence of grade 3-4 toxicity, so the dosage of irinotecan had to be reduced in the follow-up treatment. In particular, patients with homozygosity mutant *UGT1A1*6* had to discontinue irinotecan because of grade 3 or worse leukopenia and diarrhea. These identify molecular features may help us to predict the toxicity and efficacy to irinotecan. Therefore, in this retrospective study, we aimed to conduct pre-treatment *UGT1A1*6* genotyping to investigate the clinical outcomes and AEs of irinotecan in second-line treatment of GC patients.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Study Design and Clinical Data Collection\n\nA total of 110 patients with advanced GC admitted to our hospital from January 2018 to December 2020 were enrolled. All patients gave written consent for their treatment in this retrospective study. One hundred and seven patients received irinotecan as second-line chemotherapy. For patients with AA genotype, once severe AEs occur, paclitaxel became the replacement option in time. Paclitaxel was directly administered to 3 additional patients with AA genotype. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Principles. *UGT1A1* gene polymorphism was determined by single-gene and multi-gene testing platforms.\n\nThe administration of intravenous irinotecan occurred every 3 weeks, with the selection of irinotecan dosage based on the polymorphism of *UGT1A1**6 gene. This gene was categorized into 3 groups: *UGT1A1**6 wild-type (GG type) with a dosage of 125 mg/m^2^, d1, d8, *UGT1A1**6 mutant heterozygosity (GA type) with a dosage of 100 mg/m^2^, d1, d8 and *UGT1A1**6 homozygosity mutation (AA type) with a dosage of 75 mg/m^2^, d1, d8 or paclitaxel 125 mg/m^2^, d1, d8. RECIST, version 1.1, was used to evaluate clinical response every two cycles through computed tomography (CT).^ 18 ^ AEs were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0.\n\n### Statistical Analyses\n\nUsing the CTCAE, version 5.0, we calculated survival, and we compared survival curves using the log-rank test. In addition to the Cox proportional hazard regression model, survival differences among groups were also evaluated by univariable and multivariate analyses. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were presented as the survival ratios. With Fisher's exact test and Student's *t*-test, the relationship between genotyping and irinotecan toxicity was analyzed using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Two-sided tests were conducted, and *p *< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n## Results\n\n### Patient Baseline Clinical Features\n\nThis study included 110 advanced GC patients who underwent irinotecan monotherapy as second-line therapy. The baseline characteristics were summarized in [Table 1](#table1-15330338241236658). The frequencies of *TA6/TA6*, *TA6/TA7*, *TA7/TA7* for *UGT1A1*28* and GG, GA, AA genotypes for *UGT1A1*6* were 70.9%, 25.5%, 3.6% and 60.9%, 31.8%, 7.3%, respectively ([Table 2](#table2-15330338241236658)). Three patients (2.7%) carried double heterozygosity (GA and TA6/TA7). No concurrent homozygous mutations were detected.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Characteristic | Total (n = 110) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sex—no.

In addition, there were no significant differences in diarrhea (*p *= 0.136), neutropenia (*p *= 0.991), and leukopenia (*p *= 0.857) in *UGT1A1*28* subgroups. However, diarrhea (*p *= 0.000), neutropenia (*p *= 0.000), and leukopenia (*p *= 0.003) were significantly different among *UGT1A1*6* subgroups ([Table 3](#table3-15330338241236658)). Additionally, grade 3/4 diarrhea, neutropenia, and leukopenia were significantly more common in AA genotype patients compared to GG (2%, 19%, and 24%) or GA (23%, 31%, and 31%) genotype patients, suggesting that that patients with the AA genotype could not tolerate severe toxicity even with reduced doses of irinotecan.\n\n### Table 3.\n\n| Adverse events | UGT1A1*6 |  |  | p | UGT1A1*28 |  |  | p |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GG | GA | AA | TA6/6 | TA6/7 | TA7/7 |  |  |  |\n| Diarrhea |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Grade 0 | 59 (88%) | 14 (40%) | 0 (0%) | 0.000 | 55 (74%) | 15 (54%) | 2 (50%) | 0.136 |\n| Grade 1-2 | 7 (10%) | 13 (37%) | 0 (0%) | 12 (16%) | 7 (25%) | 2 (50%) |  |  |\n| Grade 3-4 | 1 (2%) | 8 (23%) | 5 (100%) | 8 (10%) | 6 (21%) | 0 (0%) |  |  |\n| Leukopenia |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Grade 0 | 45 (67%) | 10 (29%) | 0 (0%) | 0.003 | 49 (65%) | 18 (65%) | 3 (75%) | 0.857 |\n| Grade 1-2 | 9 (14%) | 14 (40%) | 0 (0%) | 14 (19%) | 6 (21%) | 1 (25%) |  |  |\n| Grade 3-4 | 13 (19%) | 11 (31%) | 5 (100%) | 12 (16%) | 4 (14%) | 0 (0%) |  |  |\n| Neutropenia |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Grade 0 | 39 (58%) | 14 (40%) | 0 (0%) | 0.000 | 45 (60%) | 17 (61%) | 2 (50%) | 0.991 |\n| Grade 1-2 | 12 (18%) | 10 (29%) | 0 (0%) | 19 (25%) | 7 (25%) | 2 (50%) |  |  |\n| Grade 3-4 | 16 (24%) | 11 (31%) | 5 (100%) | 11 (15%) | 4 (14%) | 0 (0%) |  |  |\n| Hemoglobinia |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Grade 0 | 38 (57%) | 16 (46%) | 3 (60%) | 0.477 | 59 (79%) | 17 (61%) | 4 (100%) | 0.151 |\n| Grade 1-2 | 27 (40%) | 16 (46%) | 1 (20%) | 9 (12%) | 10 (35%) | 0 (0%) |  |  |\n| Grade 3-4 | 2 (3%) | 3 (8%) | 1 (20%) | 7 (9%) | 1 (4%) | 0 (0%) |  |  |\n| Thrombocytopenia |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Grade 0 | 41 (61%) | 20 (58%) | 3 (60%) | 0.814 | 48 (64%) | 15 (54%) | 2 (50%) | 0.450 |\n| Grade 1-2 | 23 (35%) | 11 (31%) | 2 (40%) | 23 (31%) | 10 (35%) | 1 (25%) |  |  |\n| Grade 3-4 | 3 (4%) | 4 (11%) | 0 (0%) | 4 (5%) | 3 (11%) | 1 (25%) |  |  |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Adverse Events.\n\n### Efficacy of Irinotecan as Second-Line Therapy\n\nWith a median follow-up of 9.0 months (range 6.3-12.5 months), median PFS was 4.4 months in all patients. The median PFS was 4.7 months (95% CI = 4.3-5.3) in the *TA6/TA6* group, 5.0 months (95% CI = 4.1-6.2) in the *TA6/TA7* group, 5.3 months (95% CI = 2.8-NA) in the *TA7/TA7* group, 4.8 months (95% CI = 4.1-5.5) in the GG group, 4.9 months (95% CI = 4.4-5.3) in the GA group, and 4.4 months (95% CI = 3.9-NA) in the AA group ([Figure 1A](#fig1-15330338241236658), B). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.7 months in all patients. And the median OS was 9.5 months (95% CI = 8.8-10.2) in the TA6/TA6 group, 9.0 months (95% CI = 8.3-NA) in the TA6/TA7 group, 11.2 months (95% CI = 9.1-NA) in the TA7/TA7 group, 9.3 months (95% CI = 8.8-10.9) in the GG group, 9.3 months (95% CI = 8.7-NA) in the GA group, and NA (95% CI = 8.8-NA) in the AA group, respectively ([Figure 1](#fig1-15330338241236658)). In this cohort, we can see that the PFS and OS of 5 patients with AA genotype showed no difference from GG or GA genotype after timely changing chemotherapy regimen. In addition, GC with single allele variation or two alleles variation also showed no significant difference in PFS and OS ([Figure 2](#fig2-15330338241236658)).\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/74e2/10946077/ed672d355f10/10.1177_15330338241236658-fig1.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10946077_10.1177_15330338241236658-fig1.jpg)\n\nAssociation between UGT1A1 and survival outcomes.

However, the univariable analysis showed a significant association between OS and tumor differentiation, Lauren classification, surgery and metastasis sites, while no relation between OS and *UGT1A1*6* or *UGT1A1*28* ([Table 5](#table5-15330338241236658)). In a multivariate model, surgery (*p *= 0.025) and diffuse Lauren classification (*p *= 0.010) remained independent prognostic indicators for OS ([Table 5](#table5-15330338241236658)).\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| Parameter | Univariate analysis |  |  | Multivariate analysis |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| HR | 95% CI | P | HR | 95% CI | P |  |\n| Sex Male vs Female | 1.130 | 0.706-1.807 | 0.611 |   |   |   |\n| Age >65 vs ≤65 | 1.294 | 0.819-2.046 | 0.270 |   |   |   |\n| Tumor differentiation High + Moderate versus poorly | 1.062 | 0.634-1.779 | 0.819 | 1.018 | 0.528-1.963 | 0.985 |\n| LAUREN Diffuse vs intestinal | 0.886 | 0.573-1.369 | 0.584 | 0.965 | 0.523-1.780 | 0.910 |\n| Tumor location Body vs antrum + caidia | 1.039 | 0.629-1.716 | 0.880 |   |   |   |\n| ECOOG 2 vs 0-1 | 1.485 | 0.465-4.747 | 0.505 |   |   |   |\n| HER-2 status Positive vs Negative | 1.437 | 0.735-2.812 | 0.290 |   |   |   |\n| Surgery Yes or No | 0.995 | 0.492-2.012 | 0.990 | 1.023 | 0.494-2.119 | 0.951 |\n| Metastasis sites Liver or peritoneum | 1.181 | 0.763-1.827 | 0.456 | 1.198 | 0.703-2.042 | 0.507 |\n| UGT1A1*6AA + GA vs GG | 1.290 | 0.811-2.052 | 0.283 | 1.325 | 0.792-2.219 | 0.284 |\n| UGT1A1*28 TA7/TA7 + TA6/TA7 vs TA6/TA6 | 0.855 | 0.525-1.392 | 0.528 | 0.962 | 0.565-1.637 | 0.887 |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Univariate and Multivariate Analyses of Progression-Free Survival.\n\n### Table 5.\n\n| Parameter | Univariate analysis |  |  | Multivariate analysis |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| HR | 95% CI | p | HR | 95% CI | p |  |\n| Sex Male vs Female | 0.958 | 0.556-1.650 | 0.877 |   |   |   |\n| Age >65 vs ≤65 | 0.893 | 0.523-1.525 | 0.678 |   |   |   |\n| Tumor differentiation High + Moderate vs poorly | 0.449 | 0.233-0.862 | 0.016 | 0.833 | 0.376-1.848 | 0.654 |\n| LAUREN Diffuse vs intestinal | 3.374 | 1.898-6.000 | 0.000 | 2.512 | 1.242-5.083 | 0.010 |\n| Tumor location Body vs antrum + caidia | 1.006 | 0.552-1.833 | 0.984 |   |   |   |\n| ECOG 2 vs 0-1 | 2.730 | 0.369-20.205 | 0.325 |   |   |   |\n| HER-2 status Positive vs Negative | 1.041 | 0.494-2.195 | 0.915 |   |   |   |\n| Surgery Yes or No | 0.338 | 0.122-0.936 | 0.037 | 0.306 | 0.108-0.864 | 0.025 |\n| Metastasis sites Liver or peritoneum | 0.477 | 0.277-0.822 | 0.008 | 0.549 | 0.299-1.008 | 0.053 |\n| UGT1A1*6 AA + GA vs GG | 1.016 | 0.610-1.692 | 0.951 | 0.894 | 0.504-1.588 | 0.703 |\n| UGT1A1*28 TA7/TA7 + TA6/TA7 vs TA6/TA6 | 1.108 | 0.648-1.893 | 0.708 | 0.992 | 0.529-1.861 | 0.981 |\n\nTable 5 Caption: Univariate and Multivariate Analyses of Overall Survival.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe traditional approach to the dose of irinotecan has been to use body surface area (BSA).^ 19 ^ However, studies have found that the pharmacokinetic parameters of irinotecan appear to be independent of BSA, leading to a large number of clinicians questioning the validity of irinotecan dose normalization.^ 20 ^ Large evidences have confirmed that *UGT1A1* is the main metabolic enzyme that inactivates SN-38 into SN-38G. Ethnic differences in *UGT1A1* gene polymorphism are closely associated with AEs of irinotecan,^21–23^ but its efficacy remains uncertain.^15,24,25^ Most studies believed that patients with homozygous *UGT1A1*28* mutation would have serious toxic reactions, and it was suggested to reduce the dosage of irinotecan.^23,24,26,27^ To reduce the toxicity of irinotecan, FDA proposed that patients should be genotyped for *UGT1A1*28* polymorphism before treatment with irinotecan. In contrast to the rarity of *UGT1A1*28*, *UGT1A1*6* polymorphism was common in Asian populations.^ 28 ^ A recent study showed that the *UGT1A1*6* (C.211g>A) allele was more predictive of neutropenia in Korean cancer patients taking irinotecan.^ 29 ^ In addition, the presence of the homozygous *UGT1A1*6* allele was associated with an approximately 3-fold increased risk of grade 4 neutropenia in Chinese patients treated with irinotecan.^ 28 ^\n\nIn this study, we calculated irinotecan dose according to UGT1A1*6 gene polymorphism based on BSA. For patients with GG type, irinotecan was used in full dose. For patients with GA type, irinotecan was used by 20% reduction. For patients with AA type, irinotecan was used by 40% reduction. It was found that there was no significant difference in the incidence of AEs in GC patients with different *UGT1A1*28* genotypes. The incidence of these grade 3-4 toxicities was not similar to previous studies of irinotecan.^4,6^ Irinotecan dose reduction may influence the toxicity of each *UGT1A1*28* subgroup. *UGT1A1*6* gene polymorphism is significantly related to delayed diarrhea and neutropenia, which is consistent with the existing research conclusions. The incidence of adverse reactions gradually increases in patients with wild-type, mutant heterozygous and mutant homozygous. However, we found that for homozygous mutant patients, even if 40% irinotecan dose reduction, severe toxicity still occurred. Of the 8 patients with *UGT1A1*6* AA subtype, 5 had severe toxicity and were subsequently switched to paclitaxel in the following treatment. Three patients received paclitaxel treatment directly.\n\nA recent study believes that irinotecan dose reduction may reduce its toxicity, hospitalization, and even cost, but may not affect survival. It may be explained by SN-38 exposure in mutant patients after irinotecan adjustment, which is similar in wild-type patients with irinotecan normalization. GC patient had a median PFS of 2.3 months and an OS of 8.4 months using irinotecan in second-line chemotherapy.^ 4 ^ We had similar results. In this study, it did not affect the PFS (GG type 4.8 m vs GA type 4.9 m vs AA type 4.4 m; *p* = 0.5249), or OS (GG type 9.3 m vs GA type 9.3 m vs AA type NA; *p* = 0.6821). It is worth noting that, a lower dosage of irinotecan did not significantly affect PFS or OS. However, 5 had severe AEs in 8 patients with *UGT1A1*6* AA subgroup. With consideration of the possibility of reoccurrence of these AEs, paclitaxel was directly administered to 3 additional patients. Based on these findings, irinotecan may be a clinically effective drug for selective patients in non-AA subgroup.\n\nIn conclusion, there was no significant difference in clinical efficacy between low dosing irinotecan in patients with heterozygous mutations of *UGT1A1*6* gene and irinotecan with standard-dose irinotecan in wild-type patients, while patients with homozygous mutations in the *UGT1A1*6* gene achieved the same efficacy after switching to paclitaxel regimen. It proved that individual irinotecan treatment can have a good effect in patients with non-AA subtype under the guidance of UGT1A1*6 gene polymorphism. Irinotecan may be not suitable for patients with AA subtype. There are limitations in this study. The current retrospective study was conducted at a single center with a limited number of patients and therefore a selection bias. There has no control group without *UGT1A1* polymorphism tests. Patients with GA subtype had greater toxicity than patients with GG subtype, despite 20% irinotecan dose reduction.

A total of 149 Chinese AIH patients with a history of AZA treatment were retrospectively evaluated. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patients were obtained from an electronic database and reviewed. NUDT15 (rs116855232) and TPMT∗3C (rs1142345) SNPs were genotyped using a PCR method. Twelve patients developed leukopenia, and this adverse drug reaction was significantly associated with the T risk allele in NUDT15 [P < 0.00001, odds ratio = 20.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) (7.84, 53.13)], with the sensitivity and specificity of 91.67 and 89.05%, respectively. The median maintenance dosages for patients with the rs116855232 CC and CT genotypes were 1.23 (0.95, 1.53) mg ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ d−1 and 0.96 (0.83, 1.19) mg ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ d−1, respectively (P = 0.028). In contrast, no significant association was observed for TPMT∗3C genotypes. Notably, subgroup analysis of the 13 patients with leukopenia before therapy, these white blood cell (WBC) counts did not show further reduction after AZA treatment and maintenance dosage was 1.13 (0.94, 1.60) mg ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ d−1. Therefore, NUDT15 polymorphism is significantly associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia in Chinese patients with AIH and related cirrhosis. Adjusting the AZA dosage should be considered in patients according to the NUDT15 R139C genotypes.\n\nKeywords: azathioprine, leukopenia, NUDT15, autoimmune hepatitis, cirrhosis\n\n## Introduction\n\nAutoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic self-perpetuating inflammatory liver disease characterized by increased serum aminotransferase levels and autoantibodies, elevated serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the portal tract, and interface hepatitis. Misdiagnosis or treatment failure can lead to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver transplantation and rapid death ([European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2015](#B8); [Manns et al., 2015](#B21); [Montano-Loza and Czaja, 2015](#B22)). The first-line treatment for AIH involves predniso(lo)ne as an initial therapy, followed by the addition of azathioprine (AZA) after 2 weeks. The initial dosage of AZA should be 50 mg ⋅ d^−1^, which can be increased based on the toxicity and response up to the maintenance dose of 1–2 mg ⋅ kg^−1^. However, most recent studies implied that neither Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (*TPMT*) heterozygosity nor 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) metabolite levels were reliable predictors of AZA efficacy or toxicity in patients with AIH and related cirrhosis, and cytopenia is frequently encountered due to advanced fibrosis ([Czaja and Carpenter, 2006](#B6); [Heneghan et al., 2006](#B11); [Hindorf et al., 2010](#B12)).\n\nProgressive cytopenia, white blood cell (WBC) counts below 3 × 10^9^/L, or platelet counts below 50 × 10^9^/L are severe hematological side effects that justify the discontinuation of the AZA treatment ([Czaja and Carpenter, 2006](#B6)). Leukopenia, which is one of the most common and life-threatening adverse effects of AZA treatment, poses a substantial challenge to clinical practice and treatment outcomes. TPMT is a key enzyme involved in AZA metabolism. Deficiency or low activity of TPMT may generate high concentrations of the active metabolite 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN), which accounts for the therapeutic effects of AZA but is also associated with bone marrow toxicity ([Manns et al., 2015](#B21)). The gene encoding the TPMT enzyme is controlled by germline polymorphisms that lead to varied levels of enzyme activity among individuals. The risk allele frequency of rs1142345 is high in Caucasians (4%), Latino (4.8%), and African (5.4%) populations but low in East Asian (1.3%) populations^1^. Paradoxically, thiopurine-induced leukopenia is more common in East Asian individuals, and many patients who develop leukopenia after receiving AZA treatment cannot be reliably identified by genotyping or TPMT activity measurements because these patients have normal or near normal TPMT activity ([Connell et al., 1993](#B5); [Takatsu et al., 2009](#B25); [Kim et al., 2010](#B15); [Fangbin et al., 2012](#B9)). This suggests that the value of TMPT in predicting thiopurine-induced leukopenia in East Asians is limited ([Takatsu et al., 2009](#B25); [Fangbin et al., 2012](#B9)) and that unknown factors could be responsible for the inter-individual variation in thiopurine sensitivity across ethnicities ([Ban et al., 2008](#B1); [Fangbin et al., 2012](#B9); [Zhu and Cao, 2012](#B32); [Lee et al., 2015](#B17)).\n\nA genome-wide association study found that a c.415 C-to-T transition (rs116855232) variant of the nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 15 (*NUDT15*) gene results in a p.Arg139Cys substitution and is strongly associated with thiopurine-induced myelosuppression and thiopurine tolerance dose with underlying race-specific genetic polymorphisms; this result has been replicated by multiple independent studies ([Yang et al., 2014](#B29); [Tanaka et al., 2015](#B26); [Zhu et al., 2016](#B33)). We previously conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the impact of rs116855232 on thiopurine-induced myelotoxicity susceptibility and thiopurine intolerance dose. In this study, the rs116855232 variant allele resulted in a 7.86-fold (*P* < 0.00001, 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.13–10.08) increased risk of developing leukopenia with a high specificity (91.74%) and sensitivity (43.19%) and a lower thiopurine intolerance dose (*P* < 0.00001) ([Yin et al., 2017](#B31)). However, many previous studies focused mostly on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) ([Yang et al., 2014](#B29)), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ([Lee et al., 2016](#B18); [Zhu et al., 2016](#B33)), and other autoimmune diseases ([Kim et al., 2017](#B16); [Fei et al., 2018](#B10); [Yan et al., 2018](#B27)). No previous studies have focused on AIH, with the exception of our previous report on a case of AZA-induced lethal myelosuppression in a patient with AIH variant syndrome and the *NUDT15*^risk/risk^ *TPMT*^wt/risk^ genotype ([Yang et al., 2017](#B30)). As the patient group with AIH and related cirrhosis needs special attention, we conducted this retrospective study to explore the effects of *NUDT15* (rs116855232) and *TPMT* ^∗^3C (rs1142345) SNPs on AZA-induced leukopenia in Chinese patients. Additionally, we sought to confirm the impact of *NUDT15* heterozygosity on thiopurine-induced leukopenia and the tolerance dose to guide the clinical usage of thiopurines in this patient cohort.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Patients and Treatment\n\nWest China Hospital is a 4950-bed tertiary teaching hospital affiliated with Sichuan University; it has a liver transplant unit (Liver Transplantation Center, West China Hospital) and is the leading medical center in West areas of China. In total, 149 consecutive patients with AIH or AIH- primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) variant syndrome who prescribed AZA for more than 3 months were recruited at the West China Hospital between October 2013 and October 2017. Individuals were included if they met the criteria for definite or probable AIH based on the revised criteria published by the International AIH Group in 1999; AIH – PBC variant syndrome was diagnosed according to the Paris criteria ([Chazouilleres et al., 1998](#B3)). According to the recent EASL guidelines, the first line of treatment is prednisone(lo)ne followed by the addition of AZA after 2 weeks or when the bilirubin levels fall below 6 mg/dl (100 μmol/L). The AZA dose is increased based on the toxicity and response until the maintenance dose of 1–2 mg/kg is reached. Immunosuppressive agents in combination of ursodesoxycholic acid (UDCA) are often recommended for patients with AIH – PBC variant syndrome in clinical practice ([Hirschfield et al., 2017](#B13)).\n\nComplete blood counts were performed weekly during the 1st month of AZA treatment, biweekly in the following 2 months, and monthly thereafter. The researchers performed follow-up via telephone and internet communication.\n\nThe primary endpoint was leukopenia, which is defined as a WBC count less than 3 × 10^9^/L. For patients whose WBC counts were less than 3 × 10^9^/L before therapy, leukopenia was deemed progressive deterioration after treatment. The secondary endpoint was drug withdrawal for persistent or intolerant leukopenia. The dose was reduced in patients who developed leukopenia. If any laboratory abnormality did not subside, AZA was discontinued. Decisions regarding discontinuation or dose adjustment were made by the physician responsible for the personalized therapy.\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all enrolled patients.\n\n### Genetic Analyses and Azathioprine Metabolites\n\nTotal genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the Blood DNA Mini Kit (FOREGENE) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genotypes of rs116855232 and rs1142345 were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers for rs116855232 were AAGCAAATGCAAAGCATCAC and GGCTGAAAGAGTGGGGGATA, and the sequences of the forward and reverse primers for rs1142345 were ATAGGCATAATCTTTCAC and CAGCCAATTTTGAGTATTT. PCR amplification for rs116855232 starts with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s and 72°C for 60 s. Final extension was performed at 72°C for 10 min, and samples were stored at 12°C. The PCR reaction for rs1142345 starts with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s and 72°C for 60 s. Final extension was performed at 72°C for 10 min, and samples were stored at 12°C. Measurement of AZA metabolites uses high performance liquid chromatography and results are reported in pmol/8^∗^10^8^ RBCs, as previously described ([Dervieux and Boulieu, 1998](#B7)). All procedures were conducted in the Department of Laboratory Medicine of West China Hospital, which was certified by the College of American Pathologists (CAP).\n\n### Definition of Remission\n\nThe treatment responses were classified according to biochemical remission. AIH biochemical remission was defined as the normalization of transaminases and IgG, as determined using existing guidelines.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nContinuous data are presented as medians and quartiles, and categorical data are expressed as percentages. The Mann–Whitney *U*-test was performed to compare continuous variables. Chi-square tests or Fisher’s exact tests were performed to analyze differences in categorical variables between two independent groups as appropriate. The odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs associated with rs116855232 were determined by performing logistic regression analyses assuming log-additive, dominant and allele genetic models of inheritance using Review Manager 5.3 software. A two-side *P*-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software package (SPSS version 22.0 for Windows, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States).\n\n## Results\n\n### Patient Characteristics\n\nIn total, 149 consecutive patients with AIH were included in this study from October 2013 to October 2017. The female-to-male ratio was 6.95:1. Of these patients, 70 patients were diagnosed with variant AIH-PBC syndrome. Eighty-one patients were diagnosed with cirrhosis at the initiation of AZA therapy. After AZA treatment, leukopenia was observed in 12/149 patients (8.1%), 3 of whom also had transient gastro-intestinal reactions, and 2 of whom developed mild hair loss. Other side effects included pancreatitis (*n* = 1), bone aches (*n* = 1), and herpes zoster (*n* = 1). For detailed patient characteristics, see [Table 1](#T1). No significant differences were observed in age, sex, indices of liver function, disease severity or baseline WBC counts at diagnosis between the individuals with or without thiopurine-induced leukopenia (*P* > 0.05) ([Table 1](#T1)).\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Clinical features | With leukopenia (N = 12) | Without leukopenia (N = 137) | P |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age, y | 49.0(46.0, 63.5) | 52.0(44.0, 58.5) | 0.997 |\n| Female | 10(83.3%) | 119(86.9%) | >0.999 |\n| TBil, umol/L | 29.8(19.4, 55.0) | 29.6(14.5, 52.2) | 0.807 |\n| ALT, IU/L | 142.0(42.5, 181.3) | 101.0(48.0, 189.5) | 0.976 |\n| AST, IU/L | 137.0(48.3, 208.0) | 98.0(44.0, 180.0) | 0.577 |\n| ALB,g/L | 39.3(33.5, 40.9) | 39.6(35.1, 42.8) | 0.463 |\n| GLB,g/L | 42.0(34.6, 47.2) | 37.0(31.9, 42.6) | 0.083 |\n| ALP, IU/L | 139.0(93.5, 230.5) | 154.9(98.5, 267.5) | 0.867 |\n| GGT, IU/L | 124.5(37.0, 231.8) | 137.0(66.0, 301.5) | 0.330 |\n| IGG, IU/L | 24.0(17.1, 29.6) | 18.3(15.3, 25.3) | 0.244 |\n| IGM, IU/L | 2.5(1.8, 3.6) | 2.3(1.5, 3.7) | 0.861 |\n| Cirrhosis (n, %) | 8/12(66.7%) | 73/137(53.3%) | 0.372 |\n| Splenomegaly (n, %) | 6(50.0%) | 44(32.1%) | 0.348 |\n| WBC at diagnosis, ×109/L | 5.1(4.0, 5.9) | 5.0(3.9, 6.4) | 0.947 |\n| AIH/AIH-PBC | 6/6 | 73/64 | 0.827 |\n| rs116855232 CC/CT/TT | 1/9/2 | 122/15/0 | <0.001 |\n| rs1142345 TT/TC/CC | 11/1/0 | 134/2/1 | 0.283 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Baseline characteristics of the 149 patients included according to azathioprine (AZA) induced leukopenia.\n\nOf the 149 analyzed subjects, 123 subjects displayed wild-type *NUDT15* (CC; 82.6%). Twenty-four subjects were *NUDT15* heterozygotes (CT; 16.1%), and two subjects were homozygotes (TT; 1.3%), respectively. The variant allelic frequency of rs116855232 was 9.4%, while *TPMT∗3C* alleles were only observed in four subjects including 3 patients who were heterozygotes (TC) and 1 patient who was homozygous (CC). Significant differences were observed in the rs116855232 genotypes between the individuals with or without leukopenia (*P* < 0.05).\n\n### Association Between the rs116855232 Genotypes and Leukopenia\n\nFor detailed patient characteristics about association between the rs116855232 genotypes and leukopenia according to *NUDT15* genotypes, see [Table 2](#T2).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n|   | CC | CT | TT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total patients | 123 | 24 | 2 |\n| Female (n, %) | 107(87.0%) | 21(87.5%) | 1(50.0%) |\n| Age | 52.0(45.0, 58.0) | 48.0(40.5, 62.8) | 46 and 68, respectively |\n| Observation duration (weeks) | 12.0(5.0, 16.0) | 16.5 (8.3, 20.5) | 5 and 7 months, respectively |\n| AIH/Overlap | 67/56 | 11/13 | 1/1 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Combined analysis patients according to NUDT15 genotype.\n\nTherapy-induced leukopenia was observed in 9/24 (37.5%) patients with the CT allele and 2/2 (100%) patients with the TT allele. However, only one patient with wild-type homozygote allele experienced leukopenia. All cases of leukopenia developed within the first 60 days following therapy initiation or dose increase. Three of the nine (33.3%) patients developed leukopenia during remission induction, while the other 6 (66.7%) developed leukopenia during the maintenance therapy. One patient with the TT genotype experienced lethal levels of myelosuppression in the first 4 weeks of remission induction with a 1.09 mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^ prescription and reached the diagnostic criteria for grade 4 myelosuppression; this patient also carried a *TPMT*^wt/risk^ genotype. Although the AZA treatment was immediately halted and human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were prescribed to increase blood cell counts, the patient suffered a life-threatening progressive decrease in blood cell number. Subsequently, a second-line immunosuppressant (mycophenolate mofetil) was recommended after recovery from the myelosuppression. The other patient with the TT genotype was reduced to a 0.2 mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^ prescription after the WBC count from 5.29 × 10^9^/L dropped to 1.94 × 10^9^/L at the 0.9 mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^ prescription; also, WBC counts gradually increased to a satisfactory value (3–4.5 × 10^9^/L) after the dosage adjustment.\n\nWhen evaluated by rs116855232 genotype, leukopenia was significantly associated with the T allele [*P* < 0.00001, odds ratio = 20.41; 95% CI (7.84, 53.13)], with the sensitivity and specificity of 91.67 and 89.05%, respectively ([Table 3](#T3)). The NUDT15 variant allele had a high predictability for leukopenia (42.3%, 11/26).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n|   | CT (n = 24) | CC (n = 123) | TT (n = 2) | Dominant model OR (95% CI) P-value | Recessive model OR (95% CI) P-value | Allele model OR (95% CI) P-value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Leukopenia |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes | 9 (37.5%) | 1 (0.8%) | 2 (100.0%) | 89.47 (10.78, 742.53) P < 0.0001 | 65.48 (2.95, 1454.21) P = 0.008 | 20.41 (7.84, 53.13) P < 0.00001 |\n| No | 15 (62.5%) | 122 (99.2%) | 0 (0%) |   |   |   |\n| Leukopenia during first 8 weeks |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes | 9 (37.5%) | 1 (0.8%) | 2 (100.0%) | 89.47 (10.78, 742.53) P < 0.0001 | 65.48 (2.95, 1454.21) P = 0.008 | 20.41 (7.84, 53.13) P < 0.00001 |\n| No | 15 (62.5%) | 122 1(99.2%) | 0 (0%) |   |   |   |\n| Maintenance dosage |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ≤1.0mg ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ d−1 | 8/17 (47.1%) | 23/75 (30.6%) | 1/1 (100.0%) | 2.26 (0.79, 6.44) | 5.86 (0.23, 147.96) | 2.33 (0.89, 6.06) |\n| >1.0mg ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ d−1 | 9/17 (52.9%) | 52/75 (69.3%) | 0/1 (0%) | P = 0.13 | P = 0.28 | P = 0.08 |\n| Therapy interruption |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Yes | 2/24 (8.3%) | 6/123 (4.9%) | 1/2 (50.0%) | 2.54 (0.59, 10.91) | 17.38 (0.99, 303.99) | 3.05 (0.93, 9.99) |\n| No | 22/24 (91.7%) | 117/123 (95.1%) | 1/2 (50.0%) | P = 0.21 | P = 0.05 | P = 0.07 |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Association between NUDT15 SNP (rs116855232) and risk of leukopenia, AZA maintenance dosage, AZA interruption.\n\n### Association Between the rs116855232 Genotype, 6-TGN Levels and Maintenance Dose\n\n6-Thioguanine nucleotide concentrations were significantly higher in the patients of *NUDT15* CT genotype [*P* = 0.002, 276.6(150.9, 501.0) vs. 145.3(87.4, 199.0) pmol/8^∗^10^8^ RBC] ([Figure 1](#F1) and [Supplementary Table S1](#SM1)).\n\n### FIGURE 1.\n\n![FIGURE 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b469/6465603/d4f320307193/fphar-10-00346-g001.jpg)\n\n6-Thioguanine nucleotide concentrations for patients with rs116855232 CC and CT genotypes were 145.3(87.4, 199.0) pmol/8 ∗108 RBC and 276.6(150.9, 501.0) pmol/8∗108 RBC, respectively (P = 0.002).\n\nIn total, 93 patients have achieved biochemical remission and began maintenance therapy as of February 2018. The AZA dose did not significantly differ between CC and CT genotypes (*P* = 0.22) when evaluated with a clinical therapeutic dose of 1.0 mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^. However, the median maintenance dosages for patients with the *NUDT15* CC and CT genotypes were 1.23 (0.95, 1.53) mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^ and 0.96 (0.83, 1.19) mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^, respectively (*P* = 0.028) ([Figure 2](#F2)). The ratio of AZA dose to 6-TGN concentration for the patients was compared between *NUDT15* CC and CT genotypes and the results showed that patients with *NUDT15* CT genotypes had much lower values (*P* = 0.013) ([Figure 3](#F3)). The maintenance dose associated with the *NUDT15* TT genotype did not reach statistical significance, as only one patient with the *NUDT15* TT genotype continued AZA therapy (0.2 mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^).\n\n### FIGURE 2.\n\n![FIGURE 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b469/6465603/7660e223732a/fphar-10-00346-g002.jpg)\n\nThe median maintenance dosages for patients with rs116855232 CC and CT genotypes were 1.23 (0.95, 1.53) mg ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ d−1 and 0.96 (0.83, 1.19) mg ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ d−1, respectively (P = 0.028).\n\n### FIGURE 3.\n\n![FIGURE 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b469/6465603/5b55d42c621c/fphar-10-00346-g003.jpg)\n\nThe median ratio of thiopurine dose to 6-TGN concentration for the patients with rs116855232 CC and CT genotypes were 0.007(0.006, 0.015) and 0.005(0.003, 0.006; P = 0.001).\n\n### Association of 6-TGN Levels With Leukopenia\n\nThe 6-TGN concentration of 61 patients ranged from 49.74 to 1583.38 pmol/8^∗^10^8^ RBC, and median 6-TGN concentration was 149.1 pmol/8^∗^10^8^ RBC. The associations of concentrations of 6-TGN with different groups were analyzed in [Supplementary Table S1](#SM1). Overall, the level of 6-TGN was not significantly different between patients with leukopenia or without leukopenia (*P* = 0.149), and no significant difference was observed between two groups, regarding to gender, AZA maintenance dosage and severity of liver disease (*P* = 0.379, 0.637, and 0.757, respectively).\n\n### Subgroup Analysis of Patients With Previous Leukopenia\n\nIn the 13 patients with leukopenia before therapy, the baseline WBC count was 2.48 (1.77, 2.86) × 10^9^/L, but these WBC counts did not show further reduction after AZA. Only one patient was *NUDT15* heterozygous (CT) but did not show progressive leukopenia after AZA therapy. Only one patient discontinued AZA because of gastrointestinal reactions; mycophenolate mofetil was subsequently administered. The maintenance dosage for the 13 patients with pre-therapy leukopenia was 1.13 (0.94, 1.60) mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^) ([Table 4](#T4)).\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| Patient | Sex | WBC count at baseline | Decompensated cirrhosis | Hypersplenism | rs116855232 (C > T) | rs1142345 (T > C) | Progressive leukopenia | Follow-up (months) | Maintenance dosage (mg ⋅ kg−1 ⋅ d−1) | Azathioprine interruption | Interruption reason |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | F | 2.99 | No | No | CC | TT | No | 17 | 1.87 | No | – |\n| 2 | F | 2.91 | No | Yes | CT | TT | No | 16 | 1.14 | No | – |\n| 3 | F | 2.80 | No | No | CC | TT | No | 10 | – | Yes | Gastro-intestinal reactions |\n| 4 | F | 2.67 | No | Yes | CC | TT | No | 16 | 0.92 | No | – |\n| 5 | F | 1.6 | Yes | Yes | CC | TT | No | 14 | 1.11 | No | – |\n| 6 | F | 2.65 | No | No | CC | TT | No | 31 | 0.83 | No | – |\n| 7 | F | 1.89 | No | Yes | CC | TT | No | 11 | – | No | – |\n| 8 | F | 2.21 | No | No | CC | TT | No | 9 | 1.69 | No | – |\n| 9 | F | 2.48 | No | No | CC | TT | No | 9 | – | No | – |\n| 10 | F | 2.76 | No | No | CC | TT | No | 3 | – | No | – |\n| 11 | F | 1.65 | Yes | Yes | CC | TT | No | 6 | 1.32 | No | – |\n| 12 | F | 2.41 | No | Yes | CC | TT | No | 4 | – | No | – |\n| 13 | M | 1.53 | No | Yes | CC | TT | No | 5 | 1.00 | No | – |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Subgroup analysis of outcome of patients with leukopenia at baseline.\n\n### rs116855232 Genotype and Biochemical Response\n\nAmong the 93 patients who reached biochemical remission, 75 (80.6%) were wild-type homozygotes, and 17 (18.3%) subjects were heterozygotes. No differences were observed in the percentage of patients who achieved biochemical remission (*P* = 0.361) or the median time to biochemical remission (*P* = 0.161; 3.0 vs. 4.0 months, respectively) between the genotypes.\n\n## Discussion\n\nOur results found that the rs116855232 but not the rs1142345 genotype was significantly associated with AZA-induced leukopenia and the maintenance dose in Chinese patients with AIH and related cirrhosis. Safety and efficacy can be maintained in most heterozygous genotype patients on AZA at lower doses of approximately 1 mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^.\n\nThe gene encoding the TPMT enzyme is highly polymorphic, thus leading to varying levels of enzyme activity in different individuals. However, only approximately 20% of leukopenia cases can be explained by *TPMT* genetic deficiencies. A large subset of patients with the wild-type genotype develop leukopenia, implying that the utility of routine *TPMT* testing is limited and that other factors are responsible for the inter-individual variation in thiopurine sensitivity ([Ban et al., 2008](#B1); [Fangbin et al., 2012](#B9); [Zhu and Cao, 2012](#B32); [Lee et al., 2015](#B17)). The present study showed a 1.7% frequency of the risk *TPMT* allele in the analyzed population, which is similar to that reported in other studies involving Chinese IBD patients. This *TPMT* polymorphism is rare in Asian populations, and the lowest frequencies have been observed in Chinese populations (∼0.9%) ([Fangbin et al., 2012](#B9); [Zhu and Cao, 2012](#B32); [Zhu et al., 2016](#B33)). This prevalence is significantly lower than the 10% prevalence reported in European populations ([Collie-Duguid et al., 1999](#B4)). Hence, the lack of significance observed for rs1142345 in the present study is likely due to its low prevalence in East Asian populations and the small sample size of our cohort.\n\nNUDT15 is a member of the nudix hydrolase enzyme family, which primarily consists of pyrophosphohydrolases that act on nucleoside diphosphates linked to other moieties. The function of NUDT15 is to hydrolyze 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-dGDP to 8-oxodGMP, which reduces their cytotoxic effects ([Carter et al., 2015](#B2)). This finding has been replicated by multiple independent studies and has expanded to several other *NUDT15* SNPs, including rs147390019 (induces p.Arg139His) ([Moriyama et al., 2016](#B23)). Pharmacological analyses and cellular drug response studies have determined that NUDT15 activity is not only controlled by genetic variants but also by *NUDT15* expression levels in the crystal structure. According to protein stability analysis in our previous study, Arg139Cys substantially changes the NUDT15 crystal structure by breaking an α-helix in the active domain and reducing the stability of mutated NUDT15 ([Yan et al., 2018](#B27)).\n\nRecent studies have found an *NUDT15* polymorphism that was significantly associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia in East Asian ALL and IBD patients, suggesting its potential as a promising biomarker for leukopenia following the initiation of thiopurine therapy in Asian populations. In, [Yang et al. (2014)](#B29) were the first to report that the *NUDT15* allele frequencies were 10.4% in Korean IBD patients. Additionally, an immunochip-based 2-stage association study revealed that rs116855232 was strongly associated with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia (*OR* = 35.6; *P* combined=4.88 × 10^−94^). This variant showed a sensitivity and specificity of 89.4 and 93.2% in Korean IBD patients, respectively ([Yang et al., 2014](#B29)). Subsequently, an association study involving 142 Japanese IBD patients treated with thiopurines replicated the association between R139C and adverse event ([Kakuta et al., 2016](#B14)). The association between R139C and early (<8 weeks) leukopenia (WBC< 3000 mm^−3^) was replicated in our Japanese IBD cohort (*P* = 1.92 × 10^−16^, odds ratio = 28.4), although the association with late leukopenia (>8 weeks) was not confirmed. Another study involving 253 Chinese IBD patients found that the *NUDT15* variant was correlated with the early, middle (8–24 weeks) and late (>24 weeks) phases of leukopenia (*OR* = 15.67, 12.06, and 3.91, respectively; *P* = 2.13 × 10^−19^, 4.51 × 10^−9^ and 0.022, respectively) ([Zhu et al., 2016](#B33)). In our study, the rs116855232 allelic frequency was 9.4%, which is similar to data obtained from Chinese IBD patients ([Zhu et al., 2016](#B33)). The rs116855232 risk allele frequency is high in East Asian (10.4%) and Hispanic (7.1%) populations but rare in Caucasian (0.46%) populations (see Footnote) ([Lek et al., 2016](#B19)). Hence, despite differences according to ethnicity, detecting rs116855232 prior to thiopurine treatment is important, particularly in East Asian and Hispanic populations. Safety and efficacy can be maintained in most *NUDT15* heterozygous genotype patients on AZA at lower doses of approximately 1 mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^, which is the basic therapeutic dosage for AIH. We propose that an adjusted AZA dosage should be considered for heterozygous genotype patients, in a disease-independent manner ([Yang et al., 2015](#B28); [Kakuta et al., 2016](#B14); [Shah et al., 2017](#B24)). We also found that patients with *NUDT15* CT genotypes had much lower ratios of AZA dose to 6-TGN concentration, implying that physicians could recommend dosing by calculating the ratio according to the *NUDT15* genotypes. This new therapeutic monitoring method may have more clinical value than blood 6-TGN concentration alone.\n\nIn addition, no study has addressed the issues of cirrhosis, previous leukopenia, and genotype heterozygosity together in AIH and related cirrhosis. It is an independent and first verification in Chinese AIH patients. It seems that in patients with liver disease fibrosis stage may influence AZA metabolism, yet our data implied that leukopenia was not associated with advanced fibrosis or splenomegaly, although [Heneghan et al. (2006)](#B11) found that advanced fibrosis predicts AZA toxicity in AIH patients. Moreover, subgroup analysis of the outcome for the 13 patients with previous leukopenia before therapy indicated that the common dose of AZA may be safe and effective for patients with wild-type *NUDT15* homozygotes. However, further prospective validation studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to provide more robust evidence for this subgroup.\n\nOur results provide confirmation of the impact of rs116855232 on AZA-induced leukopenia and tolerance dose in AIH patients. However, *TPMT* remains the most widely accepted predictor of thiopurine-induced leukopenia to date; current guidelines, including the clinical practice guidelines for AIH by EASL and AASLD, recommend *TPMT* genotyping prior to the initiation of AZA treatment ([Manns et al., 2010](#B20); [European Association for the Study of the Liver, 2015](#B8)). Because the *NUDT15* and *TPMT* variants can coexist, as we have previously reported ([Yang et al., 2017](#B30)), and methods for the detection are commercially available, *NUDT15* and *TPMT* genotyping are suggested to be routinely conducted in all patients who have a plan to use AZA medication.\n\nThe present study has some limitations. First, this investigation was a single-center cohort study, and the link between *NUDT15* gene polymorphisms and AZA related leukopenia in patients with AIH and related cirrhosis should be further analyzed in larger replication cohorts. However, AIH is a rare disease and very few centers focus on non-Caucasian AIH patients and follow a large number of these patients in a database, and we suppose that our AIH cohort gives a fairly good representation of overall *NUDT15* genotypes distribution in Chinese AIH population. A second limitation is the possibility that we may have missed some rare mutations in the *TPMT* and *NUDT15* genes, given that we were testing only the two most common mutations in Asians as a cost-effective practice using commercially available tests. As we have found that novel rare *NUDT15* variants could improve predictive sensitivity of thiopurine-induced leukopenia in children with ALL recently ([Zhu et al., 2018](#B34)), more variants need to be explored in the future. Third, given the experimental approach, the AZA metabolites were only detected in 61 (40.9%) patients.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe found that a *NUDT15* polymorphism (rs116855232) was significantly associated with AZA-induced leukopenia in Chinese patients with AIH and related cirrhosis. For patients with the heterozygous variants, low-dose AZA (0.96 mg ⋅ kg^−1^ ⋅ d^−1^) is safe for maintaining remission and achieving efficacy comparable to that observed in wild-type patients. Even for patients with previous leukopenia or cirrhosis, AZA treatment may not be contraindicated if *NUDT15* genotypes permitted.\n\n## Ethics Statement\n\nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the ethical guidelines and approved by the Ethics Committee of the West China Hospital, Sichuan University (no. 2013221) with written informed consent from all subjects.

Pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms influence inter‐individual variability in simvastatin exposure. This study investigated the effects of pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms on steady‐state simvastatin plasma levels in Thai patients. Eighty‐nine Thai patients with dyslipidemia or coronary artery disease on simvastatin treatment for at least 2 weeks without dose adjustment were recruited from King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Simvastatin lactone and acid concentrations were measured 12 h post‐dose using UHPLC–MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms, including ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5, were genotyped by MassARRAY System. The results showed that patients with the SLCO1B1 c.521TC+CC genotype had significantly higher simvastatin acid levels than those with c.521TT (0.53 vs. 0.19 ng/mL, p = 0.03). Similarly, the SLCO1B1*1b/*15 genotype was associated with higher simvastatin acid levels than SLCO1B1*1a/*1a (0.58 vs. 0.16 ng/mL, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that SLCO1B1 c.521T>C, alone or with c.388A>G (SLCO1B1*1b/*15), reduces OATP1B1 function, leading to elevated simvastatin acid levels and increased myotoxicity risk. This study confirms the association of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (c.521T>C) with higher simvastatin plasma levels in Thai patients. The study highlights the potential role of SLCO1B1 genotyping, particularly rs4149056 (c.521T>C) and rs2306283 (c.388A>G), in guiding statin therapy for Thai patients, which could help optimize treatment and reduce adverse effects such as statin‐induced myotoxicity.\n\nKeywords: pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms, plasma concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, simvastatin lactone, SLCO1B1 gene\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nSimvastatin, a 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl‐coenzyme A (HMG‐CoA) reductase inhibitor, is widely used to manage hypercholesterolemia [[1](#cts70225-bib-0001), [2](#cts70225-bib-0002)]. It is included in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) and is commonly prescribed for dyslipidemia in the Thai population [[1](#cts70225-bib-0001)]. Statins, including simvastatin, are recommended as the primary lipid‐lowering therapy in the Royal College of Physicians of Thailand's 2024 clinical practice guidelines [[2](#cts70225-bib-0002)]. Additionally, its availability in generic form makes it a cost‐effective and accessible option. While other statins are available, simvastatin remains a preferred choice due to its effectiveness, affordability, and frequent use in clinical practice. Typically prescribed in doses of 10–40 mg per day, it effectively lowers low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels by 30%–50% through enhanced LDL uptake via hepatic LDL receptors [[3](#cts70225-bib-0003), [4](#cts70225-bib-0004)]. However, despite its efficacy, simvastatin can occasionally lead to serious adverse effects, particularly involving the skeletal muscles. These adverse events range from muscle pain (myalgia) and muscle weakness (myopathy) to, in rare cases, the potentially life‐threatening condition of rhabdomyolysis. The increased systemic exposure to simvastatin, due to pharmacokinetic changes, is associated with an elevated risk of simvastatin‐induced myotoxicity [[5](#cts70225-bib-0005), [6](#cts70225-bib-0006), [7](#cts70225-bib-0007), [8](#cts70225-bib-0008), [9](#cts70225-bib-0009)].\n\nSimvastatin is administrated as an inactive form, simvastatin lactone (SVL) which is then hydrolyzed in vivo into its active form, simvastatin hydroxy acid (SVA), by nonspecific carboxylesterases present in the intestinal wall, liver, and plasma [[10](#cts70225-bib-0010)]. Both SVL and SVA are primarily metabolized through oxidative processes mediated by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 [[11](#cts70225-bib-0011), [12](#cts70225-bib-0012), [13](#cts70225-bib-0013)]. Due to its lipophilic property of simvastatin, the distribution, including influx and efflux across hepatocytes, mainly occurs via passive diffusion. Conversely, SVA, being relatively more hydrophilic than the lactone form, relies on active transport for its distribution [[14](#cts70225-bib-0014)]. The uptake of simvastatin acid is predominantly mediated by the OATP1B1 transporter, which is encoded by the *SLCO1B1* gene. Besides SLCO1B1, other members of the SLC transporter family, SLCO1B3, may also serve as transporters for simvastatin acid [[15](#cts70225-bib-0015), [16](#cts70225-bib-0016)]. Nonetheless, their roles in simvastatin pharmacokinetics are still unclear. Additionally, P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp) encoded by the *ABCB1* gene, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) encoded by the *ABCG2* gene, are also involved in the metabolism and elimination of simvastatin [[17](#cts70225-bib-0017), [18](#cts70225-bib-0018)]. Hence, the factors affecting the activity of the protein in the pharmacokinetic pathway may increase the risk of simvastatin‐induced myotoxicity [[5](#cts70225-bib-0005), [6](#cts70225-bib-0006), [7](#cts70225-bib-0007), [8](#cts70225-bib-0008), [9](#cts70225-bib-0009)].\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various genes encoding metabolizing enzymes and transporters have been implicated in inter‐individual differences in systemic exposure to simvastatin lactone (SVL) and simvastatin acid (SVA). For instance, the SNP rs4149056 c.521T>C in the *SLCO1B1* gene is strongly linked to increased systemic exposure to SVA and an elevated risk of myopathy in diverse populations [[19](#cts70225-bib-0019), [20](#cts70225-bib-0020), [21](#cts70225-bib-0021)]. Additionally, SNPs in the *ABCG2* gene, which encodes the ATP‐binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) efflux transporter, have been shown to affect simvastatin exposure [[18](#cts70225-bib-0018), [22](#cts70225-bib-0022)]. However, the effect of*ABCG2* on simvastatin pharmacokinetics is still inconclusive [[18](#cts70225-bib-0018), [22](#cts70225-bib-0022), [23](#cts70225-bib-0023)]. There is also evidence suggesting that SNPs in metabolizing genes, such as *CYP3A4***22* and *CYP3A5**3, are associated with alterations in simvastatin pharmacokinetics [[24](#cts70225-bib-0024), [25](#cts70225-bib-0025)].\n\nHowever, previous studies have been inconclusive, except for the *SLCO1B1* gene, which has a guideline for adjusting simvastatin and other statin dosages when the genotype is known [[26](#cts70225-bib-0026)]. Furthermore, most research has focused on Caucasian and some Asian populations. To date, there are no studies demonstrating the impact of pharmacokinetic (drug‐metabolizing enzyme and transporter) gene polymorphisms on steady‐state plasma concentrations of simvastatin in the Thai population. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the effects of pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms on steady‐state simvastatin plasma concentrations in Thai patients undergoing simvastatin treatment.\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods\n\n### 2.1. Participants\n\nEighty‐nine Thai patients (*n* = 89) with dyslipidemia or coronary artery diseases (CAD) and treated with simvastatin were recruited from King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH). The inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) aged < 80 years; (2) taking simvastatin for at least 2 weeks without dose adjustment; and (3) taking medicine regularly (as confirmed by the patient surveyed and the information in their electronic medical record). Participants who had the following factors were excluded from our study: (1) having hypothyroidism, advanced cancer, heavy exercise, or alcohol abuse; (2) using drugs that are CYP3A4 or OATP1B1 strong inhibitors; and (3) having hepatic or renal diseases. The study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand (IRB No. 328/63). All procedures were conducted in compliance with the international guidelines for human research protection, such as the Declaration of Helsinki, The Belmont Report, the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Guideline, and the International Conference on Harmonization in Good Clinical Practice (ICH‐GCP). Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal guardians prior to their participation in the study.\n\n### 2.2. Blood Collection\n\nBlood samples were obtained from each eligible patient in the morning at approximately 12 h after the final dose of simvastatin. The blood samples from each patient were collected in EDTA‐coated tubes (3 mL, 2 tubes) for the following analysis: (1) the whole blood from an EDTA‐coated tube (3 mL) was used for DNA extraction and genetic analysis; and (2) the 12‐h post‐dose plasma sample from an EDTA‐coated tube (3 mL) was used for the quantification of simvastatin lactone (SVL) and simvastatin hydroxy acid (SVA) concentrations in plasma using the UHPLC–MS/MS method. It was immediately separated (within 2 h) by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Plasma samples used for simvastatin analysis were immediately mixed with 1 M ammonium acetate (pH 4.5) at a 5:100 (buffer/plasma) ratio after separation and stored at −80°C until usage.\n\n### 2.3. Simvastatin Concentration Analysis Method\n\nThe steady‐state plasma concentrations (12 h after the final dose) of simvastatin lactone (SVL) and simvastatin acid (SVA) from the patients were analyzed using ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS). This method was adjusted from Partini et al. [[27](#cts70225-bib-0027)] by the Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (DMPK) unit at the Chulalongkorn Drug Discovery and Drug Development Research (Chula4DR) center. In brief, 300 μL of human EDTA‐plasma, which contained 1 M ammonium acetate at pH 4.5 and was processed immediately after blood collection, was spiked with 30 μL of 50% acetonitrile (ACN) (Burdick & Jackson), 60 μL of combined internal standards (IS) (40 ng/mL) simvastatin‐d6 (SV‐d6) and simvastatin‐d6 hydroxy acid ammonium salt (SVA‐d6), and 100 μL of 1 M ammonium acetate at pH 4.5. The analytes SVL and SVA were isolated from plasma by liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) using methyl tert‐butyl ether (MTBE) (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Japan). After centrifugation, the organic phases were transferred into new pre‐labeled microcentrifuge tubes, dried under a nitrogen evaporator, and then reconstituted with 40% ACN combined with 60% 2 mM ammonium acetate at pH 4.5. All solutions were transferred to a 96‐well U‐shaped plate and analyzed using UHPLC–MS/MS with positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes at two different periods. All standard analytes were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals. The chemical reagents (ammonium acetate, ACN, and ammonia solution (28% in Water)) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry and glacial acetic acid was obtained from Merck.\n\nChromatographic separation was performed on a Kinetex 1.7 μm C18 100 Å, 50 × 2.1 mm ID column with SecurityGuard Ultra (C18 for 2.1 mm ID column) at 45°C with a total run time per sample of 3 min. Separation of SVL and SVA was performed with gradient elution by using two different mobile phases: (A) 90% (v/v) of 2 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4) combined with 10% (v/v) ACN; and (B) 10% (v/v) of 2 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4) combined with 90% (v/v) ACN, pumping at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The analytes were monitored by using multiple‐reaction monitoring (MRM) with the transition 435.2 → 319.0 m/z for SVA, 441.2 → 318.9 m/z for SVA‐d6, 436.1 → 199.0 m/z for SVL, and 442.4 → 199.0 m/z for SVL‐d6. Integration of peak areas and determination of the concentrations were performed with Analyst 1.6.3 software (SCIEX) and MultiQuantTM 3.0.2 software.\n\nThe validated calibration standard concentrations were 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 50 ng/mL for SVL and 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 50 ng/mL for SVA. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.05 ng/mL for SVL and 0.2 ng/mL for SVA. Linearity of all analytes was observed within the range of 0.05–50 ng/mL for SVL and 0.2–50 ng/mL for SVA. Intra‐ and inter‐day precisions were ≤ 15% for three quality control levels (LQC: 0.1 ng/mL for SVL and 0.5 ng/mL for SVA, MQC: 20 ng/mL, HQC: 40 ng/mL) and ≤ 20% for the LLOQ. The accuracy of the QC samples was 80%–120% of the theoretical concentrations at the LLOQ level and 85%–115% at the three other quality control levels for the analytes.\n\nThe steady state of SVL and SVA plasma concentrations (Css) was normalized by dividing SVL and SVA concentrations by the administrated dose in milligrams (5–40 mg/day). The steady‐state concentrations per dose were presented as Css/Dose.\n\n### 2.4. Genomic DNA Preparations by QIAamp Blood Mini Kit\n\nThe genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA‐whole blood 200 μL using the QIAamp Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). The concentration of genomic DNA was assessed by using NanoDrop One for measuring genomic DNA as well as purity. The three different wavelengths were used, including 260 nm, which is suitable for measuring the amount of genomic DNA; 280 nm, which is used to evaluate contaminated protein in the sample; and 230 nm, which is used for determining the organic compound. The purity of DNA was evaluated by the ratio of optical density (OD) at 260/280 nm, which should be in the range of 1.8–2.0, and the ratio of OD at 260/230 will be in the range of 1.8–2.2.\n\n### 2.5. SNPs Genotyping Assay Using MassARRAY System by Agena Bioscience\n\nMassARRAY System (Agena Bioscience, USA) genotyping platform was used to genotype the 10 variants from seven candidate genes which were previously reported to be associated with statin‐induced myotoxicity and/or pharmacokinetic parameters of statins including *ABCB1* (rs1045642), *ABCC2* (rs717620 and rs3740066), *ABCG2* (rs2231142), *SLCO1B1* (rs4149056, and rs2306283), *SLCO1B3* (rs7311358 and rs4149117), *CYP3A4***1G* (rs2242480), and *CYP3A5***3* (rs776746). Genotyping quality control was ensured by assessing Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) deviation and potential batch effects. The QC call rate exceeded 95% for all SNPs and samples, ensuring accuracy. TyperAnalyzer software was used to generate and report the results.\n\n### 2.6. Statistical Analysis\n\nGenetic polymorphisms were assessed for concordance with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The data were tested for the normality of data distribution. Of these, our data showed a non‐normal distribution. Thus, the following analyses were performed using tests for non‐normal distribution data. Descriptive statistics of patients were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR) for non‐normal distribution of the data. The Mann–Whitney *U* test was used to compare the continuous variables between two groups. The comparison of data from more than two groups, such as the genetic polymorphisms (wildtype, heterozygous, and homozygous variant) and simvastatin plasma concentrations, was analyzed by using Kruskal–Wallis. Multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the potential impact of batch effects on the association between *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C and simvastatin acid levels. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS version 28.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). The *p* values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n## 3.

The average body mass index (BMI) in this group was 23.83 kg per square meter (kg/m^2^). In this patient group, 47.20% received a simvastatin dose of 10 mg/day, followed by 20 mg/day (38.20%), 5 mg/day (9.00%), and 40 mg/day (5.60%).

Impacts of Pharmacokinetic (PK) Gene Polymorphisms on 12‐h Simvastatin Plasma Concentrations\n\nAmong 10 SNPs from seven genes in the pharmacokinetic pathway of statins, patients with the *SLCO1B1* c.521TC+CC genotype had a significantly higher SVA compared to those with the c.521TT genotype (0.53 vs. 0.19 ng/mL, respectively) with a *p* value of 0.03 (Table [3](#cts70225-tbl-0003), Figure [1B](#cts70225-fig-0001)). According to the CPIC 2022 guidelines [[26](#cts70225-bib-0026)], the *SLCO1B1* loss‐of‐function alleles include **5* and **15*, while the normal function allele is **1*, comprising **1a* and **1b*. The diplotype‐predicted phenotypes are classified as follows: **1a/***1a*, **1a/***1b*, and **1b/***1b* are considered normal function, whereas **1* (**1a* or **1b*) combined with *5 or *15 is categorized as decreased function. *SLCO1B1***1b/***15* (decrease function) had significantly higher SVA concentrations compared to *SLCO1B1***1a/***1a* (0.58 vs. 0.16 ng/mL, *p* value < 0.001, Table [4](#cts70225-tbl-0004)). Moreover, patients with decreased OATP1B1 function, including those with **1b/***5* and **1b/***15*, showed consistent increases in simvastatin acid concentrations compared to patients with normal OATP1B1 function, with a *p* value trending towards significance (*p* = 0.07).\n\n### TABLE 3.\n\n| Gene | rs number | Alleles | Genotype | N (%) | Median Css/Dose (ng/mL) |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SVL | p | SVA | p |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Efflux transporters |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ABCB1 | rs1045642 | 3435C>T | CC | 29 (32.58) | 0.02 (0.01–0.04) | 0.70 | 0.19 (0.13–0.45) | 1.00 |\n| CT+TT | 60 (67.42) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.25 (0.12–0.44) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ABCC2 | rs717620 | −24C>T | CC | 55 (61.79) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.45 | 0.22 (0.13–0.48) | 0.67 |\n| CT+TT | 34 (38.21) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.20 (0.12–0.42) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ABCC2 | rs3740066 | 3971C>T | CC | 49 (55.05) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.96 | 0.21 (0.12–0.49) | 0.84 |\n| CT+TT | 40 (44.95) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.19 (0.12–0.44) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ABCG2 | rs2231142 | 421C>A | CC | 49 (55.05) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.54 | 0.26 (0.15–0.52) | 0.11 |\n| CA+AA | 40 (44.95) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.18 (0.10–0.34) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Uptake transporters |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| SLCO1B1 | rs4149056 | 521T>C | TT | 80 (89.88) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.33 | 0.19 (0.11–0.41) | 0.03* |\n| TC+CC | 9 (10.12) | 0.01 (0.01–0.03) | 0.53 (0.22–0.73) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| SLCO1B1 | rs2306283 | 388A>G | AA | 17 (19.10) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.53 | 0.16 (0.14–0.25) | 0.13 |\n| AG+GG | 72 (80.90) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.23 (0.12–0.53) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| SLCO1B3 | rs7311158 | 699G>A | GG+GA | 44 (49.44) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.46 | 0.19 (0.11–0.46) | 0.86 |\n| AA | 45 (50.56) | 0.02 (0.01–0.04) | 0.22 (0.13–0.40) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| SLCO1B3 | rs4149117 | 334T>G | TT+TG | 37 (41.57) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.21 | 0.19 (0.07–0.45) | 0.94 |\n| GG | 52 (58.43) | 0.02 (0.01–0.04) | 0.21 (0.13–0.43) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Drug‐metabolizing enzymes |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| CYP3A4*1G | rs2242480 | 20230G>A | GG | 43 (48.31) | 0.02 (0.01–0.04) | 0.92 | 0.23 (0.15–0.53) | 0.16 |\n| GA+AA | 46 (51.69) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.19 (0.07–0.41) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| CYP3A5*3 | rs776746 | 6986A>G | AA | 14 (15.73) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.65 | 0.17 (0.05–0.44) | 0.23 |\n| AG+GG | 75 (84.27) | 0.02 (0.01–0.04) | 0.22–0.13‐0.45) |  |  |  |  |  |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Impacts of PK gene polymorphisms on 12‐h simvastatin plasma concentrations (n = 89).\n\n### FIGURE 1.\n\n![FIGURE 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ead7/12038368/d7e59156919b/CTS-18-e70225-g001.jpg)\n\nSVL (A) and SVA (B) plasma concentrations (Css/Dose) of c.521TT and TC+CC genotype.\n\n### TABLE 4.\n\n| Polymorphisms | Frequency (%) | Median Css/Dose (ng/mL) |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SVL | p | SVA | p |  |  |\n| SLCO1B1 diplotypes |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *1a/*1a (reference) | 17 (19.10) | 0.01 (0.01–0.03) | — | 0.16 (0.12–0.24) | — |\n| *1a/*1b | 31 (34.83) | 0.01 (0.01–0.04) | 0.51 | 0.30 (0.11–0.49) | 0.10 |\n| *1b/*1b | 32 (35.95) | 0.01 (0.01–0.04) | 0.97 | 0.20 (0.08–0.48) | 0.37 |\n| *1b/*5 | 2 (2.25) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) a | 0.57 | 0.14 (0.13–0.15) a | 0.57 |\n| *1b/*15 | 7 (7.87) | 0.01 (0.01–0.03) | 0.71 | 0.58 (0.27–0.74) | < 0.001* |\n| OATP1B1 function |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Normal function (*1a/*1a, *1a/*1b, *1b/*1b) | 80 (89.88) | 0.02 (0.01–0.03) | 0.41 | 0.19 (0.11–0.41) | 0.07 |\n| Decrease function (*1b/*5, *1b/*15) | 9 (10.12) | 0.01 (0.01–0.03) | 0.53 (0.16–0.73) |  |  |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Impacts of SLCO1B1 diplotypes and OATP1B1 functions on 12‐h simvastatin plasma concentrations (n = 89).\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we assessed Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) deviation and potential batch effects. Multivariate analysis confirmed that batch effects had no impact on *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C in relation to simvastatin acid levels (Table [S1](#cts70225-supitem-0001)). Furthermore, the QC call rate exceeded 95% for both samples and SNPs, ensuring the accuracy and robustness of the genotyping results. No significant relationship was observed between other pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms and simvastatin lactone or acid concentrations.\n\n### 3.4. Influence of Simvastatin Dose on Plasma SVL and SVA Levels\n\nThe influence of different simvastatin doses on plasma SVL and SVA levels was evaluated (Tables [S2](#cts70225-supitem-0001) and [S3](#cts70225-supitem-0001)). The results showed that patients with the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C (rs4149056) TC+CC genotype exhibited higher steady‐state plasma levels of simvastatin acid (SVA) compared to TT carriers at a dose of 10 mg/day (5.83 vs. 1.95 ng/mL, *p* = 0.06). Additionally, *SLCO1B1* rs2306283 was associated with significantly higher SVA levels in patients carrying the G allele (AG+GG genotype) at the same dose (3.63 vs. 1.59 ng/mL, *p* = 0.04). There was no association between the other doses and plasma SVL and SVA levels.\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nAmong pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms affecting statin metabolism, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C and **1b/***15* diplotype were significantly associated with increased steady‐state plasma concentrations of simvastatin acid, reflecting reduced OATP1B1 function. In contrast, other SNPs, including *ABCB1* (rs1045642), *ABCC2* (rs717620, rs3740066), *ABCG2* (rs2231142), *SLCO1B3* (rs7311158, rs4149117), *CYP3A4***1G* (rs2242480), and *CYP3A5***3* (rs776746), showed no significant association, suggesting a limited impact on simvastatin pharmacokinetics in this cohort. These results emphasize the clinical significance of the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C variant in pharmacogenetic testing.\n\nThe solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 gene (*SLCO1B1*), encoding the organic anion‐transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), is primarily expressed in the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes. It is responsible for the transport of endogenous compounds and various drugs into the liver, including statins [[28](#cts70225-bib-0028), [29](#cts70225-bib-0029)]. Since simvastatin acid, an active form of simvastatin, is one of the OATP1B1 substrates, the OATP1B1‐mediated uptake of simvastatin acid from the bloodstream into liver cells is essential for both the effectiveness and safety of simvastatin treatment [[30](#cts70225-bib-0030)].\n\nSeveral single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the *SLCO1B1* gene can affect the function of the OATP1B1 transporter and alter the pharmacokinetics of statins [[31](#cts70225-bib-0031), [32](#cts70225-bib-0032)]. Among the previous publications, *SLCO1B1* c.388A>G (rs2306283, N130D) and *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C (rs4149056, V174A) are the most investigated SNPs. In our study, the allele frequencies for *SLCO1B1* c.388G and c.521C were observed to be 62.36% and 5.06%, respectively. The frequency of c.388G is lower than the approximately 75%–80% reported in previous studies on the Thai population [[33](#cts70225-bib-0033), [34](#cts70225-bib-0034), [35](#cts70225-bib-0035)]. For c.521C, the observed frequency is lower than the 12%–18% reported in other Thai studies but aligns closely with findings from another Thai cohort, which reported a 5.2% frequency for this allele [[36](#cts70225-bib-0036)]. This variation in allele frequencies could be due to differences in the genotyping methods performed.\n\nThe *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C variant (V174A) is a well‐characterized polymorphism that affects OATP1B1 localization to the cell membrane, leading to reduced hepatic uptake, increased systemic statin exposure, and a higher risk of muscle‐related adverse events [[14](#cts70225-bib-0014), [31](#cts70225-bib-0031), [37](#cts70225-bib-0037), [38](#cts70225-bib-0038), [39](#cts70225-bib-0039)]. This variant causes a valine‐to‐alanine substitution at position 174, located in transmembrane domain 5, a region critical for transporter stability and function [[38](#cts70225-bib-0038)]. In vitro studies showed that the c.521C allele results in reduced membrane expression of OATP1B1 due to mislocalization, decreasing hepatic uptake of simvastatin acid [[14](#cts70225-bib-0014)]. Functional assays demonstrated abolished transporter activity and the protein expression levels [[14](#cts70225-bib-0014), [38](#cts70225-bib-0038), [40](#cts70225-bib-0040), [41](#cts70225-bib-0041)], providing a mechanistic basis for the elevated simvastatin acid concentrations observed in c.521C carriers. Our findings align with previous studies, demonstrating that c.521T>C carriers have a significantly higher simvastatin acid concentrations than those with the c.521T allele [[21](#cts70225-bib-0021), [42](#cts70225-bib-0042), [43](#cts70225-bib-0043), [44](#cts70225-bib-0044)]. For instance, Pasanen et al. reported that c.521CC carriers had significantly higher *C* _max_ and AUC_0–∞_ for simvastatin acid than c.521TC or c.521TT carriers [[21](#cts70225-bib-0021)]. Similarly, Birmingham et al. and Jiang et al. observed significantly increased AUC and *C* _max_ of simvastatin acid exposure in Caucasian and Korean participants carrying the variant [[42](#cts70225-bib-0042), [43](#cts70225-bib-0043)], emphasizing its role in simvastatin pharmacokinetics and its clinical relevance to pharmacogenetic testing. In contrast, *SLCO1B1* c.388A>G (rs2306283) showed no significant association with simvastatin concentrations in our study, consistent with previous findings [[22](#cts70225-bib-0022), [42](#cts70225-bib-0042)]. This polymorphism has been linked to normal or slightly altered OATP1B1 function, with minimal impact on statin pharmacokinetics unless co‐inherited with c.521T>C [[42](#cts70225-bib-0042)]. However, dose‐specific analysis revealed significantly higher SVA levels in G allele carriers (AG+GG) at 10 mg/day (3.63 vs. 1.59 ng/mL, *p* = 0.04). Similarly, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C (rs4149056) TC+CC carriers had higher SVA than TT carriers at this dose (5.83 vs. 1.95 ng/mL, *p* = 0.06), with no associations at other doses. Given the small sample size in each dose group, further studies are warranted to confirm the dose‐dependent effects of pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms on simvastatin exposure.\n\nThe *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C variant is a component of the *SLCO1B1***5* and **15* haplotypes (combined with c.388G), both of which are associated with reduced transporter function [[14](#cts70225-bib-0014), [38](#cts70225-bib-0038)]. Previous studies have reported that individuals with one normal function allele (*SLCO1B1***1a* or **1b*) and one no function allele (*SLCO1B1***5* or **15*) are at an increased risk of statin‐induced myotoxicity due to impaired hepatic uptake [[14](#cts70225-bib-0014), [21](#cts70225-bib-0021), [42](#cts70225-bib-0042), [44](#cts70225-bib-0044)]. The SEARCH Collaborative Group reported a 45‐fold higher myotoxicity risk in **15/***15* carriers [[7](#cts70225-bib-0007)], while the Heart Protection Study found a significant association between *SLCO1B1***5* and muscle side effects (*p* = 0.004) [[20](#cts70225-bib-0020)].\n\nConsidering that *SLCO1B1***5* and **15* haplotypes are commonly associated with altered OATP1B1 function, we investigated the impact of genotype‐predicted phenotypes on steady‐state simvastatin plasma concentrations in the Thai population. According to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, SLCO1B1 phenotypes are classified as normal (two normal function alleles: **1a/***1a* or **1a/***1b*), decreased (one normal and one no function allele: **1/***5* or **1/***15*), or poor (two no function alleles: **5/***5* or **15/***15*) function [[26](#cts70225-bib-0026)]. In our study, 89.88% of participants exhibited normal function, while 10.12% had decreased function (**1b/***5*, **1b/***15*). No poor function phenotypes were observed. Consistent with the CPIC guideline and prior studies, participants with decreased OATP1B1 function (**1b/***15* and **1b/***5*) showed higher simvastatin acid concentrations than those with normal function (0.53 vs. 0.19 ng/mL, *p* = 0.07). This confirms that decreased OATP1B1 function leads to increased SVA exposure and a higher risk of myotoxicity [[26](#cts70225-bib-0026)].\n\nFor clinical implementation, our findings, supported by existing evidence, emphasize the critical need for genotype‐guided dosing in *SLCO1B*1 c.521T>C or **1b/***15* carriers to reduce the risk of myotoxicity. Given that simvastatin is in widespread use in Thailand under the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) due to its affordability, optimizing its use is clinically important. Additionally, when the *SLCO1B1* genotype is known, the CPIC guidelines provide guidance for clinicians to adjust statin dosage and switch statin types to reduce the risk of statin‐induced myopathy (SIM), facilitating personalized therapy that minimizes adverse drug reactions (ADR) while preserving therapeutic efficacy. However, further studies are needed to determine the direct impact of these variants on SIM outcomes in Thailand.\n\nThis study has limitations. The small sample size reduced the statistical power, potentially limiting the ability to detect significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters. Furthermore, when stratifying by dose, the sample size in each subgroup became even smaller, further reducing statistical robustness. Future studies should include larger sample sizes to improve the reliability of dose‐specific analyses. Additionally, focusing on steady‐state levels restricted the analysis to a single time point. Future research should involve larger, more diverse cohorts and multiple time points to better characterize simvastatin pharmacokinetics over time.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nOur study is the first to examine genetic polymorphisms in drug‐metabolizing enzymes and transporters that influence steady‐state simvastatin plasma levels in the Thai population. The *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C variant, either alone or in combination with c.388A>G (**1b/***15*), was significantly associated with elevated simvastatin acid levels, potentially increasing the risk of myotoxicity. According to CPIC guidelines, *SLCO1B1* genotyping (rs4149056, rs2306283) may help guide statin therapy for the Thai population once the genotype is known. However, larger studies are needed to further evaluate these pharmacogenetic effects on simvastatin exposure and myotoxicity risk.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\nS.T. and N.V. wrote the manuscript.

Studies also suggest that when these dysfunctional arousal-like symptoms emerge in youth, they may be more frequent and severe than in adults (Martin et al., [2004](#B34); Safer and Zito, [2006](#B43); Zuckerman et al., [2007](#B58)). Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable condition, and the offspring of parents with BD are more likely to develop depression or anxiety than the offspring of parents who do not have BD (Diler et al., [2011](#B13); Hillegers et al., [2005](#B24); Singh et al., [2007](#B46)).\n\nFurthermore, when the children of parents with BD develop depressive or anxiety symptoms, their risk of developing BD increases (Geller et al., [2001](#B19)). Importantly, youth with a familial risk of BD have an increased risk of developing antidepressant-induced adverse events such as the arousal-like symptoms described above (Baumer et al., [2006](#B6); Strawn et al., [2014](#B48)) and there may be genetic markers that influence the emergence of antidepressant-related adverse events, including manic symptoms.\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed to treat depression and anxiety in youth, and these symptoms may represent a prodrome to BD in high-risk youth (Tulisiak et al., [2017](#B54)). In such youth, it can be difficult to discern whether the emergence of hyperarousal symptoms is attributable to their predisposition to mania or the activating effects of antidepressants (Angal et al., [2019](#B4)). The potential risk of SSRI-induced manic symptoms in these “at risk” youth with depression or anxiety complicates clinical decision making.\n\nAlthough several open-label studies have explored alternatives to SSRIs to treat depression or anxiety in high-risk youth, there remains no definitive first-line treatment supported by large randomized controlled trials (DelBello et al., [2007](#B11); Findling et al., [2007](#B16); Geller et al., [1998](#B18)). By considering the pharmacogenetics of SSRIs and the emergence of mania-like arousal symptoms, clinicians might be able to guide therapy with genetic testing. If successful, such a strategy would represent the successful application of personalized medicine principles to the treatment of youth at risk for BD.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, we treated depressed and/or anxious youth at familial risk for BD with escitalopram, an SSRI approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents aged 12–17 years and for generalized anxiety disorder in youth aged 7–17 years and older (Emslie et al., [2009](#B15); Strawn et al., [2023](#B50)).\n\nSeveral genetic factors are relevant to escitalopram pharmacology and the risk of antidepressant-induced adverse events including *HTR2A* (Garfield et al., [2014](#B17); Kato et al., [2006](#B29); Murphy et al., [2003](#B35); Wilkie et al., [2009](#B57)), the gene for the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A); *SLC6A4* (Chang et al., [2017](#B10); Kato and Serretti, [2010](#B30); Park et al., [2015](#B39)), the gene for the serotonin transporter; and genes for cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in escitalopram metabolism, including *CYP2C19* (Aldrich et al., [2019](#B1); Joas et al., [2022](#B27); Veldic et al., [2019](#B56)) and *CYP2D6* (Herrlin et al., [2003](#B22); Ozbey et al., [2018](#B38); Sindrup et al., [1993](#B45); Tsai et al., [2010](#B53)).\n\nPharmacogenetic tests have been clinically available for decades. However, studies of their clinical utility, including several randomized clinical trials and combinatorial approaches, in children and adolescents have produced conflicting results (Altar et al., [2013](#B2); Amitai et al., [2016](#B3); Dong et al., [2016](#B14); Laje et al., [2009](#B32); Oz et al., [2020](#B37); Vande Voort et al., [2022](#B55)). The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) recently reviewed evidence for associations between escitalopram and *CYP2C19*, *CYP2D6*, *HTR2A*, and *SLC6A4*. They concluded there was enough evidence for dose adjustment for *CYP2C19* and not *CYP2D6*, *HTR2A*, or *SLC6A4* (Bousman et al., [2023](#B7)).\n\nMeanwhile, multiple analyses have suggested a relationship between these pharmacodynamic genes and antidepressant-related adverse events, including the emergence of mania and related symptoms (Chang et al., [2017](#B10); Joas et al., [2022](#B27)). Our analysis builds upon these results by examining a number of genes that are important for escitalopram metabolism and SSRI response, with a focus on adverse events, especially mania-like arousal (or hyperarousal) symptoms that emerge in the context of high-risk youth seeking treatment for depression or anxiety.\n\nIn this study, we examined whether pharmacogenetic variants were associated with the risk of escitalopram-related adverse events in depressed and/or anxious youth at familial risk for BD. We hypothesized that CYP450 enzyme metabolizer phenotypes (CYP2C19, CYP2D6) would predict dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters and that slower CYP2C19 metabolizers would confer increased risk of escitalopram-related adverse events. We also hypothesized that *HTR2A G/G* and *SLC6A4 S/S* genotypes might increase the risk of mania-like symptoms based on observed increases in rates of adverse events among these genotypes in prior studies (Chang et al., [2017](#B10); Kato and Serretti, [2010](#B30); Kato et al., [2006](#B29); Murphy et al., [2003](#B35); Park et al., [2015](#B39); Wilkie et al., [2009](#B57)).\n\n## Methods\n\nThis study was conducted at two sites, the University of Cincinnati and Stanford University, from June 2016 to April 2022, in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by their respective institutional review boards. All legal guardians and youth provided written informed consent and assent, respectively, before engaging in any study procedures.\n\n### Participants\n\nWe recruited outpatient youth aged 12–17 years who had at least one first-degree relative with bipolar I disorder and clinically significant depression and/or anxiety symptoms (operationalized as a Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (Poznanski et al., [1984](#B41)) score >35 or a Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (Anonymous, [2002](#B5)) score ≥15. Although this analysis was part of a larger randomized placebo-controlled trial, the analysis presented here sought to determine whether gene–drug interactions influence the emergence of adverse effects in response to escitalopram.\n\nThus, only the escitalopram-treated youth were included. Participants were eligible only if they were antidepressant naïve and had negative urine drug screen and pregnancy test results at the time of enrollment. Participants were excluded if they had any history of BD, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, Tourette's disorder, any psychotic disorder, intellectual disability, any neurological disease, drug or alcohol abuse in the 6 months before study participation, or any unstable medical or psychiatric condition requiring immediate hospitalization.\n\nParticipants with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder taking stable doses of stimulants or α2-agonists for 30 days before baseline were allowed to participate and continue these medications during the study. Details of the parent study's design and aims are published elsewhere (Honeycutt et al., [2022](#B25)).\n\n### Study treatment\n\nParticipants were randomized (2:1) to receive treatment with either psychotherapy + escitalopram or psychotherapy + placebo (Honeycutt et al., [2022](#B25)). All raters and clinicians were blinded to participants' treatment. Escitalopram was initiated at 5 mg daily for 1 week, increased to 10 mg for 1 week, and then titrated by the treating child and adolescent psychiatrists to a target dose of 20 mg/day, with a maximum of 30 mg. Participants' final doses ranged from 10 to 30 mg of escitalopram.\n\n### Clinical assessments\n\nOutcomes included (1) a hyperarousal event, operationalized as a two-step worsening on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Activation scale (Bussing et al., [2013](#B8)) compared with baseline and a Children's Global Assessment Scale (Shaffer et al., [1983](#B44)) score of <55; (2) maximum scores after baseline obtained from the sum of the severity scores of the 13 arousal-based items on the clinician-reported Pediatric Adverse Events Rating Scale (PAERS) (March et al., [2007](#B33)); and (3) maximum changes from baseline (or from week 4 in participants with follow-up past week 4) in Treatment-Emergent Activation and Suicidality Assessment Profile (TEASAP) (Bussing et al., [2013](#B8)) subscale scores, including (1) self-injury, suicidality, and harm to others; (2) mania; (3) akathisia, hyperkinesis, and somatic anxiety; (4) disinhibition and impulsivity; and (5) irritability subscales.\n\n### Pharmacogenetic assay\n\nAt 8 weeks or upon early termination from the study, participants provided cheek swab samples for genetic testing through a commercial pharmacogenomic test (Myriad Genetics; Mason, Ohio). We used CPIC guidelines (Caudle et al., [2017](#B9); Hicks et al., [2015](#B23)) to assign *CYP2C19* and *CYP2D6* metabolizer phenotypes based on the alleles detected (*CYP2C19*: **1, *2,*3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *17*; *CYP2D6*: **1, *2, *2A, *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *9, *10, *11, *12, *14, *15, *17, *41*, gene duplication).\n\nBecause the CPIC categories used for analysis are metabolizer phenotypes (e.g., participants with normal rates of CYP2C19 metabolism), and not discrete genotypes (e.g., participants with *CYP2C19 *1/*1* alleles), CYP metabolizer groups are referred to throughout this study as phenotypic (rather than genotypic) groups. *HTR2A* genotype comparisons were made between homozygotes for the −1438G>A (rs6311) allele (*G/G*) and homozygotes and carriers for −1438A (*A/A*, *A/G*), based on the results of prior studies of associations between *HTR2A* and antidepressant-related adverse events (Kato et al., [2006](#B29); Murphy et al., [2003](#B35); Wilkie et al., [2009](#B57)).\n\n*SLC6A4* genotype comparisons were based on homozygosity for the “short” risk allele (*S/S*) versus homozygotes and carriers for the “long” allele (*L/L* and *L/S*), as rates of adverse events have tended to be highest among *S/S* genotyped groups in prior studies (Chang et al., [2017](#B10); Kato and Serretti, [2010](#B30); Park et al., [2015](#B39)).\n\n### Pharmacokinetic analysis\n\nParticipants provided blood samples at 8 weeks or early termination. Serum escitalopram concentrations were measured using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. We used MwPharm (version 3.82; MediWare BV; Groningen, the Netherlands) using the model from Strawn et al. (Poweleit et al., [2023](#B40); Strawn et al., [2019](#B51)) as the Bayesian priors to combine measurements of serum levels with sampling time, escitalopram dose, and adherence data, as well as participants' age, weight, and height, to calculate Bayesian-estimated pharmacokinetic parameters including the 24-hour area under the curve (AUC_0–24_), maximum concentration (C_max_), trough concentration (C_trough_), and elimination half-life (t_1/2_) of escitalopram.\n\nWe compared these pharmacokinetic parameters across CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 phenotypes, modeled with a 20 mg/day dose to produce dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters. Adherence was assessed by participant-completed diaries, pill counts, and clinical reports of adherence assessed during return visits. When full details of dose timing or adherence were unavailable, we assumed that participants took their medication at a consistent time of day commensurate with clinical reports and records of dosing in the 2 weeks preceding the blood draw. We also assumed that the number of doses participants missed was most accurately reflected in pill counts when other records of missed doses (e.g., dose diaries, clinical notes, and self-reports during visits) were incomplete or inconsistent.\n\n### Statistical methods\n\nAssociations between mania-like hyperarousal and genotypic groups were compared through Fisher's exact test. Associations between dichotomous genotypic groups and continuous outcomes (pharmacokinetic parameters, max PAERS, TEASAP increases) were compared using unpaired *t*-tests for genotype groups with similar sizes and Mann–Whitney test for groups with dissimilar sizes. Associations between continuous outcomes and genotypic groups with ≥3 groups were analyzed using the method of least squares to fit general linear models for analysis of variance (ANOVA) in the context of an unbalanced distribution of metabolizer phenotypes among participants.\n\nAssociations between clinical outcomes and select pharmacokinetic parameters (C_max_, AUC_0–24_) were analyzed through unpaired *t*-tests with respect to categorical outcomes (hyperarousal) and through simple linear regression with respect to continuous outcomes (max PAERS and TEASAP increases). Dose-normalized pharmacokinetic data (C_max_, C_trough_, AUC_0–24_, t_1/2_) were used to analyze the effects of genes associated with escitalopram metabolism (*CYP2C19*, *CYP2D6*), whereas nondose-normalized pharmacokinetic data (C_max_, AUC_0–24_) were used to analyze associations with clinical outcomes to account for the effects of actual drug exposure on adverse outcomes. Because this is a preliminary study with prespecified genes of interest and hypothesized outcomes, we did not correct for multiple comparisons.\n\n## Results\n\n### Participants\n\nOne hundred and nineteen high-risk youth were enrolled in the study. Among them, 66 participants who provided samples for genetic testing were assigned to the escitalopram group, and 48 participants in this subgroup also provided blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis.

Hyperarousal events were observed in 14 participants treated with escitalopram, 12 of whom provided cheek swab samples for genetic testing, and 5 of whom provided blood samples for the analysis of serum escitalopram levels.\n\n### CYP2C19\n\n*CYP2C19* metabolizer phenotypes were almost exclusively rapid metabolizer (RM *n* = 17), normal metabolizer (NM *n* = 31), or intermediate metabolizer (IM *n* = 17), with only one ultrarapid metabolizer (UM) and no poor metabolizers (PMs). We chose to combine *CYP2C19* UM and RM phenotypes for all initial analyses. Among the 48 escitalopram-treated participants who provided samples for pharmacokinetic analysis, CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype had a significant effect on the dose-normalized AUC_0–24_ (*p* = 0.025), C_trough_ (*p* = 0.013), and t_1/2_ (*p* = 0.0008) of escitalopram ([Fig. 1](#f1)).\n\n### FIG. 1.\n\n![FIG. 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b9f4/10880264/cf2b8101fa22/cap.2023.0073_figure1.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10880264_cap.2023.0073_figure1.jpg)\n\nAnalysis of associations between CYP2C19 phenotype (including IM, NM, RM, and UM phenotypes) and pharmacokinetic parameters. CYP2C19 phenotype was associated with (A) AUC0–24 (p = 0.025), (C) Ctrough (p = 0.013), and (D) elimination half-life (t1/2; p = 0.0008), but not (B) the Cmax (p = 0.057) of escitalopram. AUC0–24, 24-hour area under the curve; Cmax, maximum concentration; Ctrough, trough concentration; IM, intermediate metabolizer; NM, normal metabolizer; RM, rapid metabolizer; UM, ultrarapid metabolizer.\n\nSlower CYP2C19 metabolizers also tended to have higher dose-normalized C_max_, though this relationship was not statistically significant (*p* = 0.057). Slower CYP2C19 metabolizers tended to have greater TEASAP “self-injury, suicidality, and harm to others” subscale scores (*F* = 2.32, df = 2, *p* = 0.09), though CYP2C19 phenotype was not associated with increases in other TEASAP subscales scores (*p* = 0.39–0.92), maximum PAERS score (*p* = 0.27), or hyperarousal events (*p* = 0.60; [Table 2](#tb2)).

Two participants were excluded from CYP2D6*-*related analyses because genetic testing indicated gene duplications without revealing which allele was duplicated, thus precluding a definitive interpretation of CYP2D6 phenotype ([Table 1](#tb1)). CYP2D6 phenotype was not associated with any dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC_0–24_ *p* = 0.52; C_max_ *p* = 0.48; C_trough_ *p* = 0.56; t_1/2_ *p* = 0.50).\n\nSlower CYP2D6 phenotypes were significantly associated with greater increases in TEASAP Akathisia, Hyperkinesis, and Somatic Anxiety subscale (*p* = 0.015; [Fig. 2](#f2)), but not with other TEASAP subscales (*p* = 0.14–0.99), maximum PAERS score (*p* = 0.51), or hyperarousal events (*p* = 0.55; [Table 2](#tb2)). Comparison between an aggregate group with normal or faster than normal metabolism (NM or UM) and an aggregate group with slower than normal CYP2D6 metabolism (IM and PM) revealed that participants with slower than normal CYP2D6 metabolism had significantly greater TEASAP disinhibition and impulsivity subscale scores than those with normal or faster than normal metabolism (mean = 3.0 vs. 1.1, *p* = 0.02).\n\n### FIG. 2.\n\n![FIG. 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b9f4/10880264/ef7da3d41157/cap.2023.0073_figure2.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10880264_cap.2023.0073_figure2.jpg)\n\nPlots of TEASAP subscale score changes grouped by CYP2D6 phenotype (including PM, IM, NM, and UM phenotypes). Slower CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes were associated with greater increases in akathisia subscale scores (p = 0.015). Participants with slower CYP2D6 phenotypes also tended to have greater increases in disinhibition scores, though this finding was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). IM, intermediate metabolizer; NM, normal metabolizer; PM, poor metabolizer; TEASAP, Treatment-Emergent Activation and Suicidality Assessment Profile; UM, ultrarapid metabolizer.\n\nThere was also a trend for those with slower than normal 2D6 metabolism to have greater mania and greater akathisia, hyperkinesis, and somatic anxiety TEASAP subscale scores (mania: mean = 2.2 vs. 0.78, *p* = 0.07; akathisia, hyperkinesis, and somatic anxiety: mean = 1.8 vs. 0.60, *p* = 0.08). Analysis of demographic characteristics of CYP2D6 phenotypic groups revealed that PM and IM groups were older (*p* = 0.004) than NM and RM groups, though accounting for age in a covariate model did not meaningfully affect the results reported above. There were no significant differences between CYP2D6 phenotypic groups with respect to gender or ancestry.\n\n### HTR2A and SLC6A4\n\nParticipants with *HTR2A A/A* or *A/G* genotypes had a greater increase in TEASAP “Self-injury, Suicidality, and Harm to Others” subscale scores relative to those with *HTR2A G/G* genotypes (*p* = 0.017). We did not have a sufficient number of participants to further analyze differences between participants with *A/A* versus *A/G* genotypes. There was no significant difference between these genotype groups with respect to other TEASAP subscales (*p* = 0.15–0.45), PAERS score (*p* = 0.39), or the hyperarousal events (*p* = 0.53; [Table 4](#tb4)).\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| Adverse events | Genotype | HTR2A |  |  | SLC6A4 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| G/G | A/A+A/G | p | S/S | L/L+L/S | p |  |  |\n| n (%) | 29 (44) | 37 (56) | 16 (24) | 50 (76) |  |  |  |\n| Hyperarousal events |   | 8 | 4 | 0.53 | 2 | 10 | 0.72 |\n| Max PAERS score, mean ± SD |   | 5.7 ± 4.8 | 6.9 ± 6.5 | 0.39 | 5.5 ± 4.3 | 6.6 ± 6.2 | 0.72 |\n| TEASAP subscale, mean ± SD |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Self-injury, suicidality and harm to others |   | 0.3 ± 1.3 | 1.7 ± 2.8 | 0.017* | 0.7 ± 1.7 | 1.2 ± 2.6 | 0.4 |\n| Mania |   | 0.7 ± 3.2 | 1.4 ± 2.6 | 0.45 | 1.0 ± 2.7 | 1.2 ± 3.0 | 0.65 |\n| Akathisia, hyperkinesis and somatic anxiety |   | 0.4 ± 2.9 | 1.4 ± 2.4 | 0.15 | 1.1 ± 2.8 | 0.9 ± 2.6 | 0.81 |\n| Disinhibition and impulsivity |   | 1.3 ± 2.9 | 1.9 ± 3.0 | 0.41 | 1.0 ± 2.3 | 1.9 ± 3.1 | 0.41 |\n| Irritability |   | 2.2 ± 3.9 | 3.6 ± 5.3 | 0.26 | 2.5 ± 4.5 | 3.2 ± 4.9 | 0.6 |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Analysis of Associations Between Pharmacodynamic Genes and Adverse Events\n\nThere was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between participants with *SLC6A4 L/L* or *L/S* versus *S/S* genotypes, including TEASAP increases (*p* = 0.40–0.81), max PAERS score (*p* = 0.72), or hyperarousal frequency (*p* = 0.72). There were no significant differences among *HTR2A* or *SLC6A4* genotypic groups with respect to gender or ancestry.\n\n## Discussion\n\nConsistent with prior studies (Bousman et al., [2023](#B7); Gram et al., [1993](#B21); Herrlin et al., [2003](#B22); Jeppesen et al., [1996](#B26); Sindrup et al., [1993](#B45)), we found that escitalopram pharmacokinetics were influenced by *CYP2C19* but not *CYP2D6.* However, in contrast to previous studies of youth (Aldrich et al., [2019](#B1)) and adults (Joas et al., [2022](#B27); Veldic et al., [2019](#B56)), we did not find a relationship between CYP2C19 phenotype and rates of adverse events. Potential reasons for this disparity include the relatively low number of CYP2C19 PMs in our study sample (see limitations below), small sample size, and differences in outcomes measures between studies (e.g., different operationalized definitions of activation/hyperarousal).\n\nThough CYP2C19 phenotype clearly influenced AUC_24_ and C_max_, and participants with greater AUC_24_ and C_max_ tended to have smaller increases in max PAERS scores, the relationship between escitalopram levels and max PAERS score was not statistically significant and there was no corresponding relationship between CYP2C19 phenotype and max PAERS scores. Though we cannot draw firm conclusions from these results, the observed tendency of participants with higher escitalopram levels to have lower max PAERS scores runs contrary to our initial hypothesis that higher serum escitalopram levels would correlate with increased rates of adverse events.\n\nOur findings also suggest that adverse outcomes of interest were influenced by *CYP2D6*. Specifically, there were associations between slower CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes and increased caregiver reports of akathisia, disinhibition, and manic symptoms. Our findings related to CYP2D6 and adverse events are especially novel and might be related to the effects of an active metabolite of escitalopram, desmethylescitalopram (DCT). Escitalopram is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19, with a minor contribution from CYP2D6.\n\nEscitalopram is metabolized by CYP2C19 to DCT (Bousman et al., [2023](#B7)), which is then preferentially metabolized by CYP2D6 to didesmethylescitalopram (DDCT) (Gram et al., [1993](#B21); Herrlin et al., [2003](#B22); Sindrup et al., [1993](#B45)). DCT is pharmacologically active with a pharmacodynamic profile distinct from escitalopram, whereas the pharmacodynamics of DDCT have yet to be characterized. DCT has a lower affinity for the serotonin transporter relative to escitalopram as well as an increased (though still relatively low) affinity for the norepinephrine transporter (Deupree et al., [2007](#B12); Owens et al., [2002](#B36); Tatsumi et al., [1997](#B52)).\n\nAlthough escitalopram is highly selective for the serotonin transporter, DCT also has low affinity for several additional receptors, including antagonism at the 5-HT_2B_, 5-HT_2C_, 5-HT_7_, and H_1_ receptors (Deupree et al., [2007](#B12)). Of note, slower *CYP2D6* metabolizers have increased DCT exposure that, in adults with major depressive disorder, may impact treatment response (Ozbey et al., [2018](#B38); Tsai et al., [2010](#B53)). Though the specific pharmacodynamic differences between escitalopram and DCT are of unclear clinical significance, they underscore the potential contribution of DCT to both the side effect profile and the *in vivo* therapeutic mechanism of escitalopram.\n\nAdverse outcomes of interest were also influenced by *HTR2A* genotype, as we found greater increases in caregiver reports of high-risk behaviors (i.e., self-harm, suicidality, and harm to others) among those with *HTR2A A/A* and *A/G* genotypes. Our findings regarding *HTR2A* seemed to run contrary to those of prior studies that found greater rates of adverse events among −1438G>A (rs6311) homozygotes (*G/G*), but a detailed examination reveals a more complex relationship between *HTR2A* genotype and antidepressant-induced side effects.\n\nAlthough we found an increase in high-risk behaviors among participants with the −1438A allele (i.e., *A/A* and *A/G* genotypes) in response to escitalopram, multiple prior studies have found increased rates of antidepressant-related somatic, but not psychiatric, adverse events among −1438G>A homozygotes (*G/G*). Homozygosity for the −1438G>A allele (*G/G*) has been shown to increase the risk of somatic symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dizziness) in adult participants treated with paroxetine in multiple studies (Kato et al., [2006](#B29); Murphy et al., [2003](#B35); Wilkie et al., [2009](#B57)).\n\nHowever, one study of escitalopram found higher rates of sexual side effects among adult participants with *HTR2A A/A* and *A/G* genotypes (Garfield et al., [2014](#B17)). As such, different *HTR2A* genotypes may be associated with different side effect profiles, with a greater risk of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dizziness among *G/G g*enotypes, and a greater risk of suicidality, harmful behavior, and sexual side effects among *A/A* and *A/G* genotypes.\n\nOne potential mechanism for the observed differences in outcomes among *HTR2A* genotypes is increased signaling through *HTR2A* among individuals with *G/G* genotypes, as molecular studies of this genotype suggest greater expression of an extended 5′untranslated region mRNA transcript that may correlate with increased translational efficiency (Smith et al., [2013](#B47)). As such, individuals with greater *HTR2A* expression (and thus activity) might be more sensitive to the somatic side effects of SSRIs due to increased expression of *HTR2A* in vascular and gastrointestinal tissue, and more responsive to treatment with SSRIs due to increased expression of *HTR2A* in neural pathways underlying symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n\nIn contrast to prior studies (Chang et al., [2017](#B10); Kato and Serretti, [2010](#B30); Park et al., [2015](#B39)), our analysis did not detect an association between *SLC6A4* and clinical outcomes. The *S* allele of *SLC6A4* has been found to increase the likelihood of mania-like arousal symptoms emerging in high-risk youth in association with enhanced activity in, and functional connectivity between, the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the right amygdala (Chang et al., [2017](#B10)).\n\n*SLC6A4* has also been implicated in treatment response to SSRIs, as youth who are homozygous for the “short” allele of *SLC6A4* (*S/S*) showed less reduction in depressive symptoms during treatment with citalopram compared with youth who were heterozygous or homozygous for the “long” allele of *SLC6A4* (*L/S*, *L/L*) (Kronenberg et al., [2007](#B31)). Reduced treatment response among *SLC6A4 S/S* genotyped individuals was observed in a separate study of anxious youth treated with escitalopram (Strawn et al., [2020](#B49)).\n\nFurthermore, high-risk youth with the *S/S* genotype may have higher baseline anxiety than *L/L* high-risk youth (Park et al., [2015](#B39)). Consistent with this, in this study, among the 16 participants with *S/S* genotypes, 15 (94%) met inclusion criteria for anxiety symptoms compared with 38 of the 50 (76%) participants with *L/L* or *L/S* genotypes.\n\nThere are several limitations to our study, especially with respect to the association between pharmacokinetic factors and clinical outcomes. First, this analysis may be underpowered to detect the influence of pharmacokinetic factors on the clinical outcomes of escitalopram treatment. Moreover, few participants had extreme CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 phenotypes. Given that increases in rates of adverse events are greatest among PMs (Aldrich et al., [2019](#B1); Joas et al., [2022](#B27); Veldic et al., [2019](#B56)), their absence among CYP2C19 phenotypes and low frequency among CYP2D6 phenotypes may have decreased our ability to detect pharmacokinetic gene–drug interactions.\n\nFuture studies of the interaction between pharmacokinetic factors and antidepressant-induced adverse events might be designed to recruit participants based on genetic test results at the time of enrollment to ensure adequate distribution and representation of extreme metabolizer phenotypes.\n\nSecond, only 9 of the 14 participants who experienced hyperarousal provided blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis. Therefore, participants who experienced hyperarousal were disproportionately under-represented in our analysis of pharmacokinetic data, thus limiting our ability to detect pharmacokinetic correlates of clinical outcomes. Future studies that seek to detect such interactions should consider gathering samples for pharmacokinetic analysis earlier in the protocol (e.g., after 4 weeks instead of the 8-week threshold used here) to decrease the odds that subjects would experience clinical deterioration that might affect their ability or willingness to provide blood samples.\n\nA third limitation is that we did not correct for multiple comparisons. Our clinical findings should be understood in the context of these multiple comparisons, warranting further study with larger sample sizes to confirm our results. Partially for this reason, this study did not analyze outcomes with respect to anxiety and depressive symptoms as our primary aim was to detect a relationship between participants' genotypes and adverse events. Future analyses will explore these and other data gathered as part of the larger study. Even if firm clinical conclusions cannot be drawn from this analysis, we hope that these results might inform future studies to better identify and characterize genetic correlates of adverse clinical outcomes induced by escitalopram and other antidepressants.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOur study suggests that the pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are influenced by CYP2C19 but not CYP2D6 phenotype. However, CYP2D6 phenotype and *HTR2A* genotype may influence the risk of adverse effects of escitalopram. Specifically, individuals with slower CYP2D6 phenotypes may be at increased risk of experiencing akathisia or worsening impulsivity. *HTR2A* genotype likely plays a role in influencing the risk of both somatic and psychiatric adverse events, with individual genotypes associated with varying types of side effects. These findings should be considered in the context of certain limitations in the study design, including small sample size. We hope these results and subsequent studies might improve tolerability and efficacy by informing the use of biomarkers in youth at risk for developing bipolar I disorder.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Ethan Poweleit, BS, for his assistance with pharmacokinetic modeling, Zeruneseay Desta, PhD, for measuring the escitalopram concentrations, and Max Tallman, MS, for his assistance with data acquisition and logistical support, and Myriad Genetics for its support with genetic testing.

Introduction\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the most prevalent gastrointestinal malignancy in both Chile and worldwide, according to GLOBOCAN’s latest reports ([1](#B1), [2](#B2)). Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone of first-line treatment for colorectal cancer in Chile, particularly for patients diagnosed with advanced disease ([3](#B3)). These regimens typically combine a fluoropyrimidine (FP), such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with leucovorin (LV) or its prodrug capecitabine alongside one or more cytotoxic agents. The most commonly used combinations include irinotecan, a topoisomerase-I inhibitor, and oxaliplatin (L-OHP), a platinum-based antineoplastic drug ([4](#B4)–[7](#B7)). Standard treatment protocols such as FOLFOX (5-FU + LV + L-OHP), CAPOX (capecitabine + L-OHP), and FOLFIRI (5-FU + LV + irinotecan) are preferred in first- and second-line therapy. In recent years, targeted therapies, including EGFR inhibitors (cetuximab, panitumumab) and the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab have been gradually integrated into treatment strategies for CRC management in Chile ([3](#B3)).\n\nNonetheless, CRC chemotherapy regimens are not exempt from adverse drug reactions (ADR), which can range from mild to severe, potentially affecting treatment adherence, quality of life and overall survival ([8](#B8)). This is particularly critical for patients receiving L-OHP-containing regimens, where cumulative toxicity necessitates intermittent rather than continuous treatment ([6](#B6), [7](#B7)). A meta-analysis shows that at least 45,7% of patients experience moderate to severe ADRs-primarily gastrointestinal, neurological, and hematological-though underreporting in clinical practice suggests this figure may be even higher ([8](#B8)). Identifying biomarkers associated with ADR risk could serve as a valuable tool for predicting, preventing and managing toxicity, ultimately optimizing the safety and efficacy of FP-based chemotherapy.\n\nPharmacogenomic research has revealed that a myriad of proteins is involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 5-FU and L-OHP. Genetic variability within a population can lead to alterations in the genes encoding these proteins affecting individual responses to FP-based chemotherapy ([9](#B9)–[12](#B12)). Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the primary enzyme responsible for 5-FU biotransformation and inactivation ([Figure 1](#f1)) is encoded by the highly polymorphic *DPYD* gene. Certain *DPYD* polymorphisms (*DPYD*2A* - rs3918290, c.1679T>G - rs55886062, c.2846A>T - rs67376798 or c.1236G>A - rs56038477) result in a complete loss of DPD function and are strongly associated with severe FP-related toxicity. Given their clinical significance, current guidelines strongly recommend *DPYD* genotyping before initiating FP chemotherapy to mitigate the risk of life-threatening adverse reactions ([13](#B13), [14](#B14)).\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Diagram illustrating pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways of Fluorouracil in liver and cancer cells.

Purple stars indicate analyzed genes in this study. Image created with BioRender.com, adapted from PharmGKB.\n\nAdditional polymorphisms have been investigated for their potential influence on FP toxicity and efficacy; however, their impact is less pronounced, and routine genotyping for these variants is not currently recommended in clinical practice. These include *DPYD* polymorphisms such as *DPYD*9* (c.85T>C *-* rs1801265*)*, and *DPYD*5* (rs1801159), polymorphisms affecting the gene encoding 5-FU’s therapeutic target thymidylate synthase (*TYMS*) 5’-UTR VTNR 2R and 3R (rs45445694) and 3’-UTR + 1494 del6 (rs16430) variants, and polymorphisms affecting the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (*MTHFR*) variants c.677C>T (rs1801133) and c.1298A>C (rs1801131) ([14](#B14)–[17](#B17)).\n\nOn the other hand, L-OHP is an alkylating agent primarily eliminated through glutathione conjugation, a process mediated by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family of enzymes ([Figure 2](#f2)). A genetic variant of the GST enzyme GSTP1 (rs1665 A>G) and the deletion of GSTM1 have been linked to peripheral neuropathy in patients undergoing modified FOLFOX6 treatment ([18](#B18)). Additionally, polymorphisms in the excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) and 2 (ERCC2) genes have been investigated in relation to L-OHP and FOLFOX toxicity, yielding conflicting results ([18](#B18)–[20](#B20)). Polymorphisms in the ABC transporters—*ABCB1* c.3435C>T (rs1045642), *ABCG2* c.421C>G (rs2231142), and *ABCC4* A>C/A>T (rs3742106)—have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including reduced survival and diminished response to FOLFOX and CAPOX treatment ([21](#B21), [22](#B22)).\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathway of a platinum compound in a cancer cell. The compound enters through transporters like SLC31A1, and can be processed for detoxification by GSTT1, GSTP1, and GSTM1. It is also transported to the Golgi via ATP7A and ATP7B. Inside the nucleus, the compound interacts with DNA, leading to damage recognition, mismatch repair, excision repair involving proteins like ERCC1 and XRCC1, and possible translesional replication. The process can result in cell death.

Purple stars indicate analyzed genes in this study. Image created with BioRender.com, adapted from PharmGKB.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that genotyping genes involved in the metabolism of 5-FU, L-OHP, and other commonly used drugs in CRC chemotherapy may provide valuable insight into the factors contributing to ADRs in CRC patients. In the best-case scenario, this approach could serve as a useful tool for assessing ADR risk in advance.\n\nOur research team has previously proposed similar predictive tools for testicular cancer (Lavanderos et al., 2019 ([23](#B23))) and hematological cancers (Martinez et al., 2020 ([24](#B24))). While both models require further validation before clinical implementation, they highlight the significant potential of pharmacogenetic tools in preventing ADRs in chemotherapy patients.\n\nTherefore, this study aims to identify polymorphic variants of *TYMS, TYMP, DPYD, GSTP1, MTHFR, ERCC2*, and *ABC* genes to establish a predictive model for ADRs in advanced CRC patients.\n\n## 2. Materials and methods\n\n### 2.1. Pre-selection of genetic variants\n\nPolymorphic variants of *TYMS, TYMP, DPYD, GSTP1, MTHFR, ERCC2*, and *ABC* genes were filtered to select the most relevant ones based on current clinical evidence. A score was given to the candidate polymorphism based on the level of clinical evidence according to the *PharmGKB* database ([https://www.pharmgkb.org/](https://www.pharmgkb.org/)). A second score was assigned based on the minor allele frequency reported in the *Ensemble* database ([https://www.ensembl.org/](https://www.ensembl.org/)). A third score was assigned based on the reported outcome of the genetic variant in terms of toxicity or progression-free survival in patients treated with FP-based chemotherapy. The fourth score was based on whether the variant caused a change in the protein’s amino acidic sequence, or on the contrary, it only affected non-coding regions of the gene (inter-intragenic and intronic regions) or was a synonymous change maintaining the protein’s original sequence. The last two scores were based on the predicted impact of amino acid substitution in the resulting protein function based on analysis of the protein sequence using the bioinformatic tools *PolyPhen* ([http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/](http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/)) and *SIFT* ([https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/](https://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/)) when possible ([Supplementary Table 1](#SM1)) ([25](#B25), [26](#B26)).\n\n### 2.2. Patients and clinical data\n\nAdvanced CRC patients who had previously consented to donate blood samples to the Biobank of Fluids and Tissues of the Clinical Hospital of the University of Chile (BTUCH), the National Cancer Institute (INC), and the Arturo López Pérez Foundation (FALP) were analyzed for this study. Inclusion criteria included: (1) patients older than 18 years diagnosed with advanced CRC (stage III or IV), (2) patients with complete clinical data available in the treating hospital, and (3) patients treated with FP-based chemotherapy (FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, CAPOX, Capecitabine) as the first line of treatment. Exclusion criteria included: (1) patients with histology other than adenocarcinoma, (2) no primary tumor specimen available, (3) included in other interventional clinical studies as part of metastatic CRC treatment, (4) patients presenting microsatellite instability, (5) patients who have abandoned their treatment for unknown reasons, (6) patients presenting secondary cancers whether or not they were under chemotherapeutic treatments, (7) patients treated only with biologic treatment as colorectal cancer therapy.\n\nClinical data was collected, including sex, age, date of diagnosis, date of death, date of first and second-line chemotherapy treatment and scheme used, anatomical pathology and medical oncology diagnosis, TNM stage, associated co-morbidities, smoking habit, alcoholic habit, ADRs within each recorded cycle, laboratory tests, imaging tests, among others. All the clinical data was documented into an eCRF (electronic case report form) on the RedCap^®^ platform and then compiled and categorized for further analysis, strictly following standardized BTUCH procedures to protect the patient’s sensitive data.\n\n### 2.3. DNA extraction from blood samples\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from a sample of 6 mL of blood from patients using the E.Z.N.A.^®^ Blood DNA Mini Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Inc. Georgia, USA.) following manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and integrity of the extracted DNA were assessed using a DeNovix DS-11 Series Spectrophotometer (DeNovix Inc. Delaware, USA.) and confirmed through 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Samples were diluted to 10–20 ng/mL for further analysis.\n\n### 2.4. Genotyping of selected genetic variants\n\nGenetic variants were primarily genotyped using real-time-qPCR using *TaqMan*™ commercial probes in a Stratagene Mx3000p Real-Time PCR System and AriaMx Real-Time PCR System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) ([Supplementary Table 2](#SM1)). The *TYMS* rs45445694 variant was analyzed through PCR-RFLP using a G-Storm Thermocycler model GS00482 (G-Storm Ltd, Somerset, England), MyTaq™ DNA Polymerase and PCR Master Mix (Bioline*®* London, U.K.). The following primers were used: forward 5’-GCGGAAGGGGTCCTGCCA-3’ and *reverse* 5’-TCCGAGCCGGCCACAGGCAT-3’ (IDT Fermelo-Biotec, Chile). Genotypes were determined based on PCR product size, visualized on either a 2% agarose gel or an 18% polyacrylamide gel. A 102 bp product corresponded to the 2R/2R homozygous genotype, a 130 bp product to a 3R/3R homozygous genotype, and the presence of both bands indicated a heterozygous (2R/3R) genotype.\n\n### 2.5. Statistical analysis\n\nPatients were categorized into two groups: exposed (carriers of the risk allele) and non-exposed (carriers of the non-risk allele). The primary outcome was defined as the occurrence of any ADR and its severity, graded from 1 (less severe) to 4 (more severe) according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) guideline v5.0 ([27](#B27)).\n\nDescriptive statistical analyses were conducted for all collected data using the measures of central tendency, including mean, median, and standard deviation (SD). The presence and severity of ADRs during the FP-based treatment were analyzed through logistic regression, with results expressed as the corresponding Odds Ratio (OR) and p-value. Genetic variants were assessed using co-dominant, recessive, and dominant inheritance models. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using a stepwise selection method, with the optimal model chosen based on sensitivity, accuracy, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.\n\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using the R version 4.2.2 in RStudio version 2022.12.0 + 353. A statistical power of 80% and a significance level of 95% were considered for all analyses.\n\n### 2.6. Ethical considerations\n\nThis study was approved by the Scientific Ethical Committee of the North Metropolitan Health Service and the Scientific Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile. It was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (1964), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and Chilean National Laws N° 20.120, N° 19.628, and N° 20.584.\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Selection of genetic variants\n\nTo identify relevant genetic variants, we compiled a comprehensive database of variants associated with the response to 5-FU, L-OHP, and irinotecan from the PharmGKB database ([https://www.pharmgkb.org/](https://www.pharmgkb.org/)). Each variant was evaluated based on the criteria outlined in [Supplementary Table 1](#SM1), leading to the selection of 16 genetic variants for further analysis. These variants included: *TYMS* (rs4544694 and rs11280056), *TYMP* (rs11479), *DPYD* (rs6737679 and rs1801265), *GSTP1* (rs1695), *MTHFR* (rs1801131 and rs1801133), *ERCC2* (rs13181), *ABCB1* (rs1045642 and rs1128503), *ABCC2* (rs717620), *ABCC4* (rs9561778), and *ABCG2* (rs2231142).\n\n### 3.2. Patient clinical characteristics\n\nA total of 82 patients with advanced CRC were recruited from BTUCH, INC, and FALP for this study. The characteristics of the participants are summarized in [Table 1](#T1). The sex distribution among participants was 58.5% male and 41.5% female. 14.6% of patients reported smoking habit, 21.9% reported to be ex-smokers (> 1 year) and 34.1% reported alcohol consumption. Most patients received FOLFOX or CAPOX as first-line chemotherapy, and 36.6% required a second-line chemotherapy regimen.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Variable |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Sex | Percentage % | n |\n| Male | 58.5 | 48 |\n| Female | 41.5 | 34 |\n| Age at diagnosis (yr) |   |   |\n| Average ± S.D. | 60 ± 12.6 |   |\n| Median | 63 |   |\n| Smoking habits | Percentage % | n |\n| Smoker | 14.6 | 12 |\n| Ex-smoker | 21.9 | 18 |\n| Non-smoker | 54.9 | 45 |\n| N.A. | 8.5 | 7 |\n| Alcohol drinking habits | Percentage % | n |\n| Drinker | 34.1 | 28 |\n| Non-drinker | 51.2 | 42 |\n| N.A. | 14.6 | 12 |\n| First-line chemotherapy | Percentage % | n |\n| 5-FU/LV | 1.2 | 1 |\n| Capecitabine | 15.8 | 13 |\n| CAPOX | 42.7 | 35 |\n| FOLFOX | 31.7 | 26 |\n| FOLFOX + Cetuximab | 2.4 | 2 |\n| FOLFOX + Bevacizumab | 2.4 | 2 |\n| FOLFIRI | 2.4 | 2 |\n| FOLFIRI + Cetuximab | 1.2 | 1 |\n| Second-line chemotherapy | Percentage % | n |\n| Yes | 36.6 | 30 |\n| No | 63.4 | 52 |\n| 5-FU/LV | 3.3 | 1 |\n| 5-FU/LV + Cetuximab | 6.7 | 2 |\n| Capecitabine | 6.7 | 2 |\n| FOLFIRI | 46.7 | 14 |\n| Capecitabine + Irinotecan | 3.3 | 1 |\n| FOLFIRI + Aflibercept | 3.3 | 1 |\n| FOLFIRI + Cetuximab | 13.3 | 4 |\n| FOLFOX | 10.0 | 3 |\n| FOLFOX + Bevacizumab | 6.7 | 2 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Characteristics of patients.\n\n### 3.3. Genotype frequencies of the selected genetic variants in the study population\n\nResults of genotype frequencies are shown in [Table 2](#T2). We initially considered analyse of *DPYD* SNPs c.1905 + 1G>A (*DPYD*2*) (rs3918290) and c.1679T>G (*DPYD*13*) (rs55886062). However, genotyping of both polymorphisms revealed no variability (*DPYD*2* G/G genotype and *DPYD*13* genotype T/T for all patients), and therefore both were omitted from the statistical analyses.\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Gene variant | Genotype / percentage % (n) |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TYMS 3’UTR 6bp ins-del (rs11280056) | INS/INS | INS/DEL | DEL/DEL |\n| 0.29 (24) | 0.41 (34) | 0.29 (24) |  |\n| TYMS 5’UTR TSER (rs45445694) | 2R/2R | 2R/3R | 3R/3R |\n| 0.11 (9) | 0.72 (59) | 0.17 (14) |  |\n| TYMP c.1412C>T (rs11479) | C/C | C/T | T/T |\n| 0.76 (62) | 0.20 (16) | 0.04 (4) |  |\n| DPYD c.1905+1G>A (DPYD*2) (rs3918290) | G/G | G/A | A/A |\n| 1 (82) | 0 (0) | 0 (0) |  |\n| DPYD c.1679T>G (DPYD*13) (rs55886062) | T/T | T/G | G/G |\n| 1 (0) | 0 (0) | 0 (0) |  |\n| DPYD c.2846A>T (rs67376798) | T/T | T/A | A/A |\n| 0.98 (80) | 0.01 (1) | 0.01 (1) |  |\n| DPYD c.85T>C (DPYD*9) (rs1801265) | T/T | T/C | C/C |\n| 0.60 (49) | 0.30 (25) | 0.10 (8) |  |\n| GSTP1 c.313A>G (rs1695) | A/A | A/G | G/G |\n| 0.43 (35) | 0.39 (32) | 0.18 (15) |  |\n| MTHFR c.1409A>C (rs1801131) | A/A | A/C | C/C |\n| 0.59 (48) | 0.35 (29) | 0.06 (5) |  |\n| MTHFR c.788C>T (rs1801133) | C/C | C/T | T/T |\n| 0.31 (25) | 0.47 (39) | 0.22 (18) |  |\n| ERCC2 c.2251A>C (rs13181) | A/A | A/C | C/C |\n| 0.72 (59) | 0.23 (19) | 0.05 (4) |  |\n| ABCB1 c.3435T>C (rs1045642) | C/C | C/T | T/T |\n| 0.33 (27) | 0.51 (42) | 0.16 (13) |  |\n| ABCB1 c.1236T>C (rs1128503) | T/T | T/C | C/C |\n| 0.13 (11) | 0.55 (45) | 0.32 (26) |  |\n| ABCC2 c.-24C>T (rs717620) | C/C | C/T | T/T |\n| 0.71 (58) | 0.25 (21) | 0.04 (3) |  |\n| ABCC4 c.3366+1243C>A (rs9561778) | C/C | C/A | A/A |\n| 0.93 (76) | 0.05 (4) | 0.02 (2) |  |\n| ABCG2 c.421C>A (rs2231142) | C/C | C/A | A/A |\n| 0.88 (72) | 0.10 (8) | 0.02 (2) |  |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Genotype frequencies of the selected genetic variants in the study population.\n\n### 3.4. ADR in the study population\n\nWe identified 54 types of ADR occurring during chemotherapy. After categorizing them according to the CTCAE guideline v5.0, we observed that most commonly affected system was the gastrointestinal, followed by the nervous system, and fatigue, pain, hematological disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. Additionally, ADRs were classified by severity, with grades 0 to 2 considered non-severe and grades 3 to 4 considered severe. The frequency distribution of these classifications is presented in [Table 3](#T3).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n| Type of ADRs | Presence % (n) |  | *Severity % (n) |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yes | No | Not severe (Grade 0-2) | Severe (Grade 3-4) |  |\n| Gastrointestinal disorders | 82.9 (68) | 17.1 (14) | 84.1 (69) | 15.9 (13) |\n| Haematological disorders | 40.2 (33) | 59.8 (49) | 85.4 (70) | 14.6 (12) |\n| Pain | 46.3 (38) | 53.7 (44) | 95.1 (78) | 4.9 (4) |\n| Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders | 19.6 (11) | 80.4 (71) | 98.0 (50) | 2.0 (1) |\n| Fatigue | 53.7 (44) | 46.3 (38) | 98.8 (81) | 1 (1.2) |\n| Nervous system disorders | 74.5 (38) | 25.5 (31) | 92.2 (47) | 7.8 (4) |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Frequency of ADRs among patients.\n\nSome remarkable ADR contained in these categories are the presence of gastrointestinal disorders, where mucositis occurred in 34.1% (n: 28) and vomiting in 29.4% (n: 24) of patients (data not shown). The presence of neuropathy, included in the nervous system disorders, occurred in 37.8% (n: 31) of patients. Finally, thrombocytopenia occurred in 17.1% (n: 14) and anemia affected in 20.7% (n: 17) of patients, both included in the hematological disorders category.\n\n### 3.5. Univariate analysis of the correlation between genotypes and toxicities\n\nThe next stage of analysis involved evaluating the correlation between the polymorphisms in the *TYMS*, *TYMP*, *DPYD*, *GSTP1*, *MTHFR*, *ERCC2*, and *ABC* genes and the risk of ADR of any severity during FU-based chemotherapy. This was done using univariate logistic regression and applying different inheritance models (dominant, recessive, and codominant), with the results of these analyses shown in [Table 4](#T4). We identified a protective correlation between the 6bp deletion of the *TYMS* 3’UTR region (rs11280056) and a lower risk of gastrointestinal and hematological disorders in chemotherapy patients. Additionally, the C/C genotype of the *ERCC2* rs13181 polymorphism was correlated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal disorders in our study population.\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| ADR/Polymorphism / Model | Genotypes | OR | CI (95%) | p-value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gastrointestinal disorders |  |  |  |  |\n| TYMS 3’UTR 6bp ins-del (rs11280056) |  |  |  |  |\n| Codominant | INS/INS | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| INS/DEL | 0.152 | 0.007 – 0.991 | 0.093 |  |\n| DEL/DEL | 0.100 | 0.004 – 0.071 | 0.045* |  |\n| ERCC2 c.2251A>C (rs13181) |  |  |  |  |\n| Codominant | A/A | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| A/C | 0.152 | 0.007 – 0.991 | 0.093 |  |\n| C/C | 0.100 | 0.004 – 0.710 | 0.045* |  |\n| Hematological disorders |  |  |  |  |\n| TYMS 3’UTR 6bp ins-del (rs11280056) |  |  |  |  |\n| Codominant | INS/INS | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| INS/DEL | 0.156 | 0.044 – 0.498 | 0.002* |  |\n| DEL/DEL | 0.029 | 0.004 – 0.182 | 0.001* |  |\n| Dominant | INS/INS | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| INS/DEL + DEL/DEL | 0.107 | 0.030 – 0.303 | <0.0001* |  |\n| Recessive | INS/INS + INS/DEL | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| DEL/DEL | 0.075 | 0.004 – 0.421 | 0.015* |  |\n| GSTP1 c.313A>G (rs1695) |  |  |  |  |\n| Dominant | A/A | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| A/G+G/G | 0.298 | 0.013 – 0.617 | 0.001* |  |\n| Recessive | A/A+A/G | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| G/G | 0.157 | 0.048 – 0.414 | 0.0005* |  |\n| Pain |  |  |  |  |\n| TYMP c.1412C>T (rs11479) |  |  |  |  |\n| Dominant | C/C | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| C/T+T/T | 5.860 | 1.381 – 31.420 | 0.027* |  |\n| ABCB1 c.1236T>C (rs1128503) |  |  |  |  |\n| Recessive | T/T+T/C | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| C/C | 4.200 | 1.038 – 19.256 | 0.049* |  |\n| MTHFR c.1409A>C (rs1801131) |  |  |  |  |\n| Codominant | A/A | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| A/C | 0.355 | 0.126 – 0.947 | 0.042* |  |\n| C/C | 0.750 | 0.028 – 19.827 | 0.842 |  |\n| Dominant | A/A | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| A/C+C/C | 0.375 | 0.137 – 0.976 | 0.048* |  |\n| Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders |  |  |  |  |\n| TYMS 5'UTR 2R3R (rs45445694) |  |  |  |  |\n| Recessive | 2R/2R + 2R/3R | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| 3R/3R | 6.400 | 1.188 – 36.705 | 0.029* |  |\n| Nervous system disorders |  |  |  |  |\n| GSTP1 c.313A>G (rs1695) |  |  |  |  |\n| Codominant | A/A | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| A/G | 0.352 | 0.045 – 1.906 | 0.251 |  |\n| G/G | 0.098 | 0.011 – 0.570 | 0.015* |  |\n| Recessive | A/A+A/G | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| G/G | 0.182 | 0.040 – 0.759 | 0.020* |  |\n| MTHFR c.1409A>C (rs1801131) |  |  |  |  |\n| Dominant | A/A | 1.000 | -- | Ref. |\n| A/C+C/C | 5.805 | 1.324 – 40.992 | 0.035* |  |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Univariate analysis of the correlation between the risk of ADRs and genotypes.\n\nThe G allele of the *GSTP1* rs1695 polymorphism was correlated with a lower risk of hematological and nervous system disorders in treated patients, including a reduced risk of neuropathy. This was observed through the analysis of individual ADR using univariate logistic regression without CTCAE v5.0 grouping ([Supplementary Table 3](#SM1), OR = 0.01, p-value = 0.008). However, we observed a higher risk of mucositis in patients carrying this polymorphism ([Supplementary Table 3](#SM1), OR = 2.27, p-value = 0.036).\n\nFurther analysis of ungrouped ADRs indicated a higher risk of neuropathy in patients carrying the C allele of the *DPYD* rs1801265 polymorphism ([Supplementary Table 3](#SM1), codominant model T/C genotype OR = 30.0, p-value = 0.0049, dominant model OR = 4.583, p-value = 0.05).\n\nAdditionally, we found a direct correlation between the T allele of the *TYMP* rs11479 polymorphism and an increased risk of pain in chemotherapy patients. Similarly, patients carrying the C/C genotype of the *ABCB1* rs1128503 polymorphism exhibited a higher risk of pain. Conversely, the C allele of the *MTHFR* rs1801131 polymorphism was correlated with a lower risk of pain, but a higher risk of nervous system disorders in chemotherapy patients. Lastly, the 3R/3R genotype of the *TYMS* rs45445694 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. No correlation was found between the risk of grouped and ungrouped ADR, and the other polymorphisms considered in this study.\n\nWhen analyzing the risk of grouped ADR while considering only severe reactions (Grade III-IV), we found that only the *TYMS* 3’UTR 6bp deletion (rs11280056) was the only polymorphism associated with a lower risk of severe hematological disorders (dominant model OR = 0,098, CI 95% 0.013 – 0.441, p-value =0.005).\n\n### 3.6. Multivariate analysis of genotypes and toxicities\n\nBased on the univariate analysis of selected polymorphisms and the risk of grouped and ungrouped ADRs, we filtered all polymorphisms that resulted in an association with a p-value < 0.02 for step-by-step multivariate logistic regression. Our goal was to develop a multivariate model with good specificity and accuracy, incorporating at least two genetic variants.\n\nUsing the of *TYMP* rs11479 and *ABCB1* rs1044642 genetic polymorphisms, we generated the best predictive model for anemia (ungrouped ADR), applying a recessive inheritance model for both variants. The model is shown in [Table 5](#T5), and the corresponding ROC curve is displayed in [Figure 3](#f3).\n\n### Table 5.\n\n| Variable |  | β | SE | OR | CI (95%) | p-value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercept |  | -3.667 | 1.602 | 0.026 | 0.001 - 0.428 | 0.022 |\n| ABCB1 (rs1045642) T/T |  | -1.877 | 1.119 | 0.153 | 0.007 - 0.975 | 0.093 |\n| TYMP (rs11479) T/T |  | 3.168 | 1.53 | 23.760 | 1.722 - 986.648 | 0.038* |\n| Significancy and accuracy parameters of the model |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| χ² | Degrees of freedom | Model’s p-value | Pseudo-R2 | Accuracy | Sensitivity | AIC |\n| 7.22 | 2 | 0.027* | 0.145 | 71.795 | 0.231 | 48.422 |\n\nTable 5 Caption: Multivariate model of the correlation between the TYMP rs11479 and ABCB1 rs1044642 genotypes and the risk of anemia.\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n![Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve graph showing true positive rate versus false positive rate.

Discussion\n\nDespite the life-threatening risk posed patients with DPD deficiency ([28](#B28)), in Chile genotyping of *DPYD* genetic variants is still not recommended by the national clinical guidelines for CRC management or for other cancers that require FP-based chemotherapy schemes. Thus, in this study, we aimed to establish a correlation between the patient’s genotype and the risk of ADR in Chilean advanced CRC patients. Similarly, another Chilean study demonstrated that certain *DPYD* genetic variants, not included in this study, are associated with 5-FU toxicities, either in combination with L-OHP individually or alongside *UMPS* (rs1801019) and *ABCC2* (rs717620) genetic variants ([29](#B29)).\n\nIn this study, we included the *DPYD* genetic variant rs1801265, which, unlike other *DPYD* variants, is present in 26% of the world population ([30](#B30)). The C allele was identified as a risk factor for the development of neuropathies. The association of this genetic variant and ADR risk has been described in some recent studies ([31](#B31)), with evidence suggesting that analyzing genetic variants not associated with enzyme loss-of-function, such as rs1801265, can provide insights into DPD enzyme function and the risk of developing ADR in 5-FU treatment’s ([32](#B32)). These studies recommend haplotype analysis or exome sequencing, which could improve the understanding of ADR risk and DPD enzyme function.\n\nThe main therapeutic target of 5-FU is the inhibition of the TS enzyme ([Figure 1](#f1)). Among the key genetic variants, the 6bp deletion in the 3’UTR (rs11280056) was associated with a decreased risk of gastrointestinal and hematological ADRs. These findings contrast with previous studies, which reported that this polymorphism, along with *TYMS* 5’UTR TSER (rs45445694) is associated with increased severity of hematological ADR. However, those studies were based on a small sample size (6 patients with ADR) ([33](#B33)). This same genetic variant has also been linked to an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy ([34](#B34)) and severe hand-foot-syndrome ([35](#B35)). Additionally, 5-FU exerts a secondary effect by covalently binding to DNA and RNA, thereby inhibiting cellular replication and transcription. Similarly, L-OHP acts directly by binding to DNA, preventing these processes. At this stage, DNA repair systems play a crucial role, as their inhibition can influence ADR occurrence. Several SNPs in key DNA-repair genes, such as *ERCC2* can impact these pathways. One of the most studied SNPs in this research is rs13181 (c.2251A>C), which causes structural alterations in the protein, affecting its DNA-binding ability. In this study we observed that the CC genotype was a protective factor against gastric ADR. However, this result contradicts previous studies, where the CC genotype was linked to a reduction in chemotherapy dose requirements ([36](#B36)). Other studies have failed to find an association between this genotype and ADR risk ([37](#B37)). These discrepancies may be explained by mRNA overexpression as a compensatory mechanism for decreased enzyme functionality, a phenomenon previously described for ERCC1 in relation to survival ([38](#B38)). *In vitro* studies are needed to validate this hypothesis.\n\nWithin 5-FU pharmacokinetics, thymidate phosphorylase (TP) is a key enzyme responsible for initiating the activation of 5-FU into its active metabolite, which inhibits TS. Additionally, TP is crucial for the biotransformation of capecitabine (5-FU pro-drug). The *TYMP* c.1412C>T (rs11479) genetic variant, is a missense mutation that induces a structural change in the protein, affecting its catalytic activity. In this study it was observed that the T allele was associated with pain development. This same variant has previously been linked to early development of ADR onset in CRC patients undergoing fluoropyrimidine treatment ([39](#B39)).\n\nFor 5-FU metabolites to effectively inhibit TS, the folate cycle must be functional, as it generates TS’s secondary substrate. Without this substrate, TS is unable to bind FdUMP preventing its inhibitory activity ([Figure 1](#f1)). The MTHFR enzyme plays a crucial role in this process, as it catalyzes the conversion of 5,10-MTHF to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) ([40](#B40)). The *MTHFR* rs1801133 (c.788C>G) genetic variant induces a protein conformational change, reducing enzyme activity, which may contribute to ADR risk in this treatment ([41](#B41)). In our study, the C allele was associated with an increased risk of nervous system ADR, yet it also acted as a protective factor against pain development. These findings have not been previously reported. Past research has only linked this variant to asthenia ([42](#B42)), mucositis, diarrhea and neutropenia ([43](#B43)).\n\nL-OHP is an alkylating agent primarily eliminated through glutathione conjugation, mediated by glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes ([Figure 2](#f2)). One of the most studied SNPs associated with CRC treatment-related ADR is *GSTP1* rs1695 (c.313A>G), which alters protein structure ([44](#B44)). Our findings indicate that the A allele is associated with an increased risk of hematological and nervous system ADR, aligning with previous studies ([45](#B45)). Interestingly, we also observed that the G allele was associated with a higher incidence of mucositis in this cohort, a novel finding that has not been reported before.\n\nRegarding multivariate models, only two models were successfully generated, one predicting anemia risk and another predicting pain risk. In the study by Deng et al., 2020, *DPYD* and *GSTP1* were identified has strong predictors of ADR, including anemia ([46](#B46)). In contrast, our anemia predictor model incorporated *ABCB1* and *TYMP* variants, which have not been previously associated with anemia risk. However, it is important to note that the *ABCB1* variant was not statistically significant within the model. Previous studies have linked anemia risk solely to *DPYD* variants ([47](#B47)), unlike the finding of this study.\n\nThese findings emphasize the importance of considering population-specific genetic variability in cancer pharmacogenomic analyses. However, the relatively small sample size, gaps in clinical records, and lack of longitudinal follow-up limit the broader applicability of our results. Future research should prioritize larger, multiethnic cohorts—particularly from European populations—to validate these findings and further the development of personalized medicine.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThis study provides a foundation for developing pharmacogenetic-based predictive models for adverse reactions associated with 5-FU, including nervous system disorders, mucositis, and hematological and skin toxicities. Future research may refine these models to enable personalized dose adjustments, improving chemotherapy safety in Chilean colorectal patients.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank to the Biobank of Fluids and Tissues of the University of Chile and National Institute of Cancer of Chile.\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThe author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

However, atypical antipsychotics are most commonly prescribed in pediatric patients for off label uses including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette Syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ([3](#R3)–[5](#R5)). Atypical antipsychotic use in children peaked in the mid-2000s and was associated with a trend in initiating prescriptions at a younger age, although antipsychotic use has continued to rise in adolescents since that time ([3](#R3),[6](#R6)).\n\nMultiple adverse events (AEs) associated with risperidone have been established in adults, including weight gain, sedation, prolongation of the corrected QT interval (long QTc), tardive and withdrawal dyskinesia, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia ([2](#R2),[7](#R7),[8](#R8)). There are fewer data on the side effect profile and long term effects of atypical antipsychotics in pediatric patients ([3](#R3)). Children are at higher risk than adults for AEs following antipsychotic exposure, and emerging evidence indicates that children and adolescents are at higher risk for hyperprolactinemia, weight gain, and metabolic abnormalities compared to adults ([3](#R3),[5](#R5)).\n\nRisperidone is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 enzyme while other enzymes such as CYP3A4 contribute less to the metabolism ([9](#R9)). The *CYP2D6* gene is highly polymorphic ([10](#R10)). Common polymorphisms lead to loss of function, gene deletion, or gene duplication, leading to a spectrum of CYP2D6 activity from complete lack of function in poor metabolizers to excessive function in ultrarapid metabolizers ([11](#R11)). In the Caucasian population, 1-2% of individuals are CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers; 77-92% are normal metabolizers; 2-11% are intermediate metabolizers; and 5-10% are poor metabolizers ([12](#R12)). Recent studies have shown that CYP2D6 status may affect the risk of AEs in individuals exposed to risperidone ([13](#R13)). Some studies in adults suggest a significant association between *CYP2D6* genotypes and pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or adverse effects of risperidone, while others have found no association ([14](#R14)–[17](#R17)). There are few studies examining the relationship of CYP2D6 status to drug levels, drug efficacy, or AEs in children; the small number of studies published to date have conflicting results ([4](#R4),[18](#R18)–[21](#R21)). There are no specific national or international guidelines for prescribing risperidone based on the *CYP2D6* genotype of individual patients ([4](#R4)).\n\nThis retrospective cohort study assessed the association between CYP2D6 status and the risk for AEs in pediatric patients exposed to risperidone for at least 4 weeks. Our hypothesis was that individuals with reduced CYP2D6 enzyme activity have increased AEs compared to individuals who are normal metabolizers.\n\n## METHODS\n\n### Study Design and Cohort\n\nData for this study were obtained from BioVU, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) biobank linking DNA to de-identified electronic health records (EHR) ([22](#R22)–[24](#R24)). This study was reviewed by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board and determined to be non-human subjects research. Previous studies documenting most AEs in specific subgroups of pediatric patients were limited to ≤8 weeks ([25](#R25)–[27](#R27)). Therefore, we performed a preliminary search of children exposed to risperidone for ≤8 weeks. No patient exposed to risperidone for <4 weeks had any form of AEs. Hence, our study inclusion criteria were limited to use of risperidone for ≥4 weeks; age ≤18 years at the time of initial dose of risperidone; and non-compromised DNA sample available in BioVU. Exclusion criteria were management of patients on risperidone by non-VUMC providers and insufficient follow up data, such as lack of records of prescribed dose of risperidone or unclear data on presence or absence of AEs. Individuals whose CYP2D6 status was ambiguous based on genetic results excluded from analysis after genotyping was performed.\n\n### Primary Outcome and Identification\n\nThe primary outcome of this study was AEs in individuals taking risperidone. AEs were defined as any untoward event identified by the patient or their parent/guardian, observed by a physician, or detected following a change in laboratory investigation (e.g. increase in fasting blood glucose level just before the AE compared to baseline level at the commencement of risperidone) that was documented in the EHR and attributed to risperidone. As a retrospective study, no causality assessment was performed to establish the relationship between the AEs and risperidone. The presence or absence of AEs was identified through manual review of the EHR for each individual, blinded to CYP2D6 status.\n\n### Data Abstraction\n\nData for this study were collected and stored in REDCap, an electronic data management tool hosted by VUMC. The following data were extracted for each individual in the study cohort: demographic data (sex, race, ethnicity, and age at time of risperidone start), pertinent clinical information (indication for risperidone, mental health diagnoses, and medical comorbidities), medication data (risperidone dosage amount, risperidone dosing schedule, risperidone duration, and number and type of concomitant drugs including strength and number of any CYP2D6 inhibitors) ([28](#R28)), and presence or absence of AEs. Specific risperidone dosage modifications (increase, decrease or discontinuation) were noted. If AEs were documented in the EHR data, specific details surrounding the event were recorded, including the type of AE, timing of AE in relation to risperidone start date, dose of risperidone at the time of AE, further management steps taken by the prescriber, and any subsequent use of antipsychotic medications.\n\n### DNA Analysis\n\nDNA from each individual was analyzed in order to determine their CYP2D6 functional status. *CYP2D6* analysis was performed using the Kailos TargetRich™ PGx Panel Next Generation sequencing assay (Kailos Genetics, Inc, Huntsville, AL) performed by the Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics (VANTAGE) laboratory using reagents and protocols as specified by the manufacturer. Processing steps include restriction digestion, patch ligation, enzymatic clean up, on-bead purification, universal PCR amplification, library quality control, and sequencing of the pooled and normalized libraries using a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA). An additional long-range PCR to determine *CYP2D6* deletions or duplications was performed using the primers specified in [Supplemental Table S1](#SD1) (online). Genotypes were assigned to known *CYP2D6* star alleles per [Supplemental Table S2](#SD1) (online), and then individuals were characterized as poor metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, normal metabolizers, or ultrarapid metabolizers based on predicted CYP2D6 function as shown in [Supplemental Table S3](#SD1) (online) ([29](#R29),[30](#R30)). In cases of duplication with heterozygosity, allelic balance of the specific variants identified was used to determine which allele was duplicated. All variants defining an allele were required to have at least 55% of the reads in favor of one allele and less than 45% in favor of the other to support duplication of the allele. If the allelic balance was unable to identify the duplicated allele, possible metabolic statuses were considered. In instances of unambiguous metabolic status (e.g. *1×N/*2 and *1/*2×N are both ultrarapid), the first allele was selected as duplicated. In some instances, the metabolic status was ambiguous (e.g. *1×N/*10 and *1/*10×N are ultrarapid and normal, respectively), in which case the individual was excluded from analysis.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nPatients with poor and intermediate metabolizer statuses were combined and analyzed as poor/intermediate metabolizers. Patients with normal and ultrarapid metabolizer status were combined and analyzed as normal/ultrarapid metabolizers. All demographics, clinical variables, and medication outcomes were calculated as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables. Characteristics of poor/intermediate metabolizers were compared to those of normal/ultrarapid metabolizers using Fisher’s exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with AEs as the primary outcome, adjusting for age, sex, race, and risperidone dose. We also tested for associations of concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors with AEs in normal/ultrarapid metabolizers using Fisher’s exact test and multivariate logistic regression with AEs as the primary outcome, adjusting for age, sex, race, and risperidone dose. Data analysis was performed using STATA v15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). All statistical tests were 2-sided and any *P* value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### Study Cohort and CYP2D6 Analysis\n\nOf 520 individuals initially identified in a search for risperidone exposed children and adolescents in BioVU, 270 (52%) met inclusion criteria. Due to the highly polymorphic nature of *CYP2D6* and the added complexity of copy number variants, definitive resolution of specific alleles is not always possible during sequencing which can lead to ambiguity of metabolizer status for some individuals. In our study, of those who met the inclusion criteria, 13 individuals were excluded from the cohort due to ambiguous CYP2D6 status (7 unknown metabolizer status, 1 normal versus ultrarapid metabolizer, and 5 intermediate versus normal metabolizers). The remaining 257 individuals were predominantly male (188; 73%), white (217; 84%), and non-Hispanic (246; 96%), with a median age of 8.3 (IQR 6.3-10.5) years at initiation of therapy ([Table 1](#T1)). *CYP2D6* genotyping indicated that 15 (6%) were poor metabolizers, 18 (7%) were intermediate metabolizers, 218 (85%) were normal metabolizers, and 6 (2%) were ultrarapid metabolizers ([Table 1](#T1)). A complete list of *CYP2D6* diplotypes identified is included in [Supplemental Table S3](#SD1) (online).

The most common AEs were weight change (9%), sedation (6%), and extrapyramidal symptoms (6%). In total 5/15 (33%) poor, 10/18 (56%) intermediate, 58/218 (27%) normal, and 3/6 (50%) ultrarapid metabolizers experienced AEs. All AEs documented in this cohort with the frequency of each AE by metabolizer status are listed in [Supplemental Table S4](#SD1) (online). In univariate analysis, AEs were more common among poor/intermediate metabolizers than normal/ultrarapid metabolizers (15/33, 46% vs. 61/224, 27%, *P*=0.04) ([Table 2](#T2)). No demographic or baseline characteristics were associated with CYP2D6 status, but race (*P* =0.04) and presence of aggression (*P* =0.03) or self-injurious behaviors (*P* <0.001) were associated with AEs ([Supplemental Table S5](#SD1) (online)). In multivariate analysis, the risk for AEs, after adjustment for age, sex, race, and initial risperidone dose was higher for poor/intermediate metabolizers compared to normal/ultrarapid metabolizers (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.1-5.1, *P* =0.03), ([Figure 1](#F1)).\n\n### Figure 1:\n\n![Figure 1:](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2ca3/6435416/32016dc3c366/nihms-1518655-f0001.jpg)\n\nLogistic regression of adverse events during risperidone treatment in children. Shown are the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CYP2D6 poor/intermediate vs. normal/ultrarapid metabolizers, adjusted by risperidone dose, age at start of risperidone, sex, and race\n\nOf the 224 normal/ultrarapid metabolizers, 20 (9%) were taking one or more concomitant drugs that are known strong inhibitors of CYP2D6. The frequency of AEs was not different among those with a strong concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitor (6/20, 30%) versus those without (55/204, 27%, *P*=0.8). In multivariate analysis adjusting for risperidone dose, age, sex, and race, the adjusted odds ratio for AEs with concomitant strong CYP2D6 inhibitor use in normal/ultrarapid metabolizers was 1.2, 95% CI 0.4-3.3, *P*=0.7.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nThis study demonstrates that children who are CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizers have increased incidence of AEs during risperidone treatment, with consistent results in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In total, almost one third of the children treated with risperidone experienced an AE. The high AE rate merits close monitoring in children treated with risperidone and consideration of alternate therapies, as the therapeutic risk may exceed the potential benefit, particularly for those with impaired CYP2D6 function and potentially for those with ultrarapid CYP2D6 function.\n\nThe increased incidence of AEs in pediatric patients during risperidone exposure with decreased or no CYP2D6 activity in our study is consistent with findings reported by other pediatric studies. Youngster, *et al.* performed an observational study of 40 pediatric patients with autism spectrum disorder and risperidone exposure which showed a trend of increased AEs such as weight gain and tardive dyskinesia in 2 CYP2D6 poor metabolizers but no AEs in the 2 ultrarapid metabolizers ([20](#R20)). Two prior studies, including 81 and 120 individuals up to 20 years of age, have shown an increased risk for weight gain in those with reduced CYP2D6 activity, although one of these studies included multiple other atypical antipsychotics in addition to risperidone ([31](#R31),[32](#R32)). Another study showed a correlation between serum prolactin levels and CYP2D6 status in 25 children, although there was no association with AEs ([19](#R19)). A study of 45 pediatric patients with autism spectrum disorder showed reduced weight gain in 8 ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers, although 1 poor and 36 normal metabolizers had similar outcomes ([18](#R18)). Across all of these studies, potential reasons for the differences in results include variable definitions of AEs, different indications for risperidone, differences in alleles genotyped, and small sample size of some metabolizer subgroups. However, taken together, these studies do suggest an increased rate of risperidone AEs, particularly for increased frequency of weight gain, in pediatric patients with decreased or no CYP2D6 activity.\n\nRisperidone is metabolized to paliperidone by CYP2D6, and paliperidone is an active metabolite ([13](#R13)). Some studies suggest that the ratio of risperidone to paliperidone, as determined by CYP2D6 phenotype, may affect the type of AEs that an individual is at risk to develop ([1](#R1)). For example, prolactin levels correlate with paliperidone levels, so ultrarapid metabolizers may be at increased risk for hyperprolactinemia ([19](#R19)). In our cohort, 3 ultrarapid metabolizers experienced 4 different adverse events, and no ultrarapid metabolizers experienced hyperprolactinemia or gynecomastia. Due to the small number of ultrarapid metabolizers in our cohort, we are not able to make definitive conclusions regarding specific AEs among this subset ([Supplemental Table S4](#SD1) (online)).\n\nClinical *CYP2D6* testing is available from a variety of commercial and academic laboratories, and there are resources available to assist in assigning metabolizer status based on the genetic variants identified ([33](#R33),[34](#R34)). For risperidone, there are no formal guidelines recommending changes in dosing or use of an alternative drug based on *CYP2D6* genotype ([4](#R4)). It may be particularly difficult to provide automated genotype-guided prescribing advice for this drug due to the wide range of indications for which risperidone is used. The potential risks and benefits for each patient must be weighed, and CYP2D6 status can be taken into consideration. Based on our evidence and that which has been previously reported, if a patient already has *CYP2D6* test results available, clinicians should consider alternative antipsychotic or mood stabilization therapy in poor and intermediate metabolizers. If risperidone is initiated in poor or intermediate CYP2D6 metabolizers, clinicians should consider to lower the initiation dose and slowly titrate dose thereafter. Also, counseling on the increased risk of AEs should be stressed as well as the importance of routine monitoring for metabolic and movement abnormalities ([35](#R35)). Increased vigilance is also warranted in ultrarapid metabolizers as they may also be at increased AE risk. As a corollary, for those patients already at high risk for risperidone AEs or for whom risperidone AEs will be particularly problematic (e.g. overweight or obese patients, patients with underlying neurological disorder), pre-prescription *CYP2D6* testing to assess the potential risks and benefits may be beneficial.\n\nCYP2D6 status is not the only risk factor for AEs in children treated for risperidone. In this cohort, an indication of self-injurious behaviors or aggression was associated with higher AEs. Race was also associated with AEs in univariate analysis, though was not significantly associated in the multivariable analysis including metabolizer status. In one prior study, younger age and higher dose at risperidone initiation were associated with increased weight gain ([36](#R36)). Another small study showed no association between AE risk and indication, age, BMI, gender, dose, or therapy duration ([37](#R37)). However, robust investigations of the risk factors for risperidone AEs are lacking. Further work in this area is needed in order to provide an evidence basis for safe use of this drug in young patients.\n\nIn this cohort, concomitant use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors was not associated with risperidone AEs. There are few pediatric studies examining the use of CYP2D6 inhibitors and risperidone metabolism, and there is uncertainty surrounding their clinical effect on AEs ([38](#R38)). Although some resources include consideration of drug-drug interactions of risperidone with CYP2D6 inhibitors ([39](#R39)), our data suggest that genotype is a stronger predictor of risk.\n\nWe recognize several limitations of this study. Data from this study are from a single center and may not be generalizable to other pediatric populations. AEs were identified retrospectively via EHR, and thus may be affected by inaccurate or insufficient documentation. Many individuals of this study were taking concomitant medications, and although there was no statistical evidence of this variable as a confounder, caution should be used when contributing the association of AEs to risperidone. In spite of our relatively large sample size, ultrarapid, intermediate, and poor metabolizer subgroups were small. Thus, we were unable to assess all phenotype classes individually or identify a trend across all classes due to inadequate power in these smaller phenotype groups. The ultrarapid metabolizer group is of particular interest as it remains unclear if they are at increased risk for AEs, and with 6 ultrarapid metabolizers in this cohort analysis of this group was not possible.\n\nWe did not perform causality assessment between the AEs and risperidone to exclude concomitant medications as the likely cause of the AEs or exclude erroneous documentation of AEs that are unlikely to be related to risperidone exposure. Such erroneous AEs include subjective weight gain without using specific indices to assess age-based weight gain, and the rare AEs (e.g. bruising) that have not been established to be risperidone-related. However, our findings are within the scope of AE definition, which refers to any problem occurring at the time a medicine is used, whether or not it is identified as a cause of the problem ([40](#R40)). It is hoped that larger prospective studies would address this problems in the future.\n\nIn summary, our results indicate that children with CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizer phenotype are at increased risk of risperidone related AEs. This study along with others suggests clinical relevance of this enzyme, with increased pediatric AE rates associated with decreased or no CYP2D6 enzyme activity with risperidone exposure ([18](#R18),[20](#R20),[31](#R31),[32](#R32)). Thus, if a child or adolescent is known to have CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolism, clinicians should consider alternate therapy or a reduced dosing regimen while emphasizing counseling on risks of AEs as well as the importance of routine monitoring to identify AEs during treatment.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgements:\n\nData extraction and formatting was performed by Christian Shaffer, Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\n**Financial Support:** This work used a dataset from Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s BioVU which is supported by institutional funding and by the CTSA grant UL1 TR000445 from NIH/NCATS.

Introduction\n\nKidney transplantation is currently the only curative therapeutic option for end-stage renal diseases that severely impair normal kidney function. Notably, the kidney is the most frequently transplanted solid organ worldwide, accounting for approximately 65 % of all transplants. This intervention necessitates lifelong administration of multiple pharmacological agents aimed at modulating the patient's immune response to promote graft tolerance while maintaining defenses against infectious agents. The therapeutic regimen typically includes corticosteroids (initially and in cases of suspected rejection) and chronic immunosuppressive therapy, particularly with calcineurin inhibitors, among which tacrolimus is the most commonly prescribed. All patients in our cohort received tacrolimus, as it significantly reduces acute rejection rates and improves long-term graft survival ([Mayer et al., 1997](#bib23)).\n\nDespite its effectiveness, tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic range and is associated with several adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity, increased susceptibility to infections, post-transplant diabetes mellitus, neurotoxicity, hypertension, and malignancies, which may limit its use ([Ekberg et al., 2007](#bib7)). Furthermore, significant interindividual variability in plasma concentrations is frequently observed, both over time within the same patient and across different patients. This variability can be attributed to various factors, including concomitant drug use, dietary habits, herbal supplements, and intrinsic factors such as sex, age, serum albumin levels, hematocrit, and genetic variants. Of particular relevance are genetic polymorphisms in pharmacogenes encoding proteins involved in the transport and metabolism of tacrolimus, as these can affect plasma drug levels, potentially leading to reduced therapeutic efficacy and/or increased incidence of adverse effects.\n\nTacrolimus pharmacokinetics involve several enzymes, including P-glycoprotein (encoded by the ABCB1 gene), an ATP-dependent efflux pump that facilitates the excretion of tacrolimus from intestinal cells into the lumen, promoting its elimination via feces or metabolism. Tacrolimus undergoes extensive metabolism primarily in the liver and intestinal wall by CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 enzymes, generating at least eight distinct metabolites ([Iwasaki, 2007](#bib13)), some of which may contribute to tacrolimus toxicity ([de Jonge et al., 2009](#bib5)). These metabolites are excreted predominantly via bile (∼97 %) and, to a lesser extent, urine (∼2 %). Despite the well-established involvement of these enzymes, data on their specific roles in tacrolimus metabolism remain inconsistent, and the pharmacological activity of tacrolimus metabolites requires further investigation. Less than 1 % of tacrolimus is excreted unchanged in urine and feces ([Henkel et al., 2023](#bib11)). Thus, genetic variants in the genes encoding these proteins (pharmacogenes) that affect their function could alter drug transport and metabolism, potentially leading to plasma tacrolimus levels that fall outside the therapeutic range, thereby reducing immunosuppressive efficacy and increasing the risk of adverse events, particularly in long-term therapeutic regimens. Consequently, pharmacogenetic studies could help predict patient outcomes in certain cases. Although short-term studies on kidney transplantation have been previously reported, the information of longer follow-up periods is scarce. As far as we know, no previous study covers the period of time we consider in the present work.\n\nMost previous studies investigating potential pharmacogenetic variants associated with treatment success have focused on single or small sets of SNPs and short follow-up periods. Given the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms involved in drug metabolism, there is growing evidence that simultaneous analysis of broader panels of variants, including those in additional pharmacogenes, could help identify new associations and rule out nonspecific ones ([Steinbach et al., 2022](#bib33); [Niedrig et al., 2021](#bib25)). Therefore, in this study, we evaluated a panel of 37 SNPs previously reported as relevant variants located in 14 pharmacogenes involved in key ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) mechanisms. Considering the unique context of organ transplantation, both donors and recipients were genotyped. This study was conducted in a cohort of 79 kidney transplant recipients who underwent transplantation in 2008 and 2009 at Hospital Universitario y Politécnico La Fe (Valencia, Spain). Clinical events commonly observed in transplant patients were collected from medical records during a 12-year follow-up period, and potential associations with pharmacogene variants were analyzed.\n\n## 2. Material and methods\n\n### 2.1. Patients\n\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the Institutional Ethics Board Committee of Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain (registry number: 2008/0263). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study included adult kidney transplant recipients (aged >18 years) who underwent transplantation between March 2008 and December 2009 and were treated with tacrolimus (n = 79). Three patients were excluded due to early loss of clinical follow-up or lack of genetic data. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were retrospectively obtained from electronic health records with the approval of the Hospital Ethics Committee of Medicines Research (reference: 2021-370-1).\n\n### 2.2. Immunosuppressive therapy\n\nTacrolimus (Prograf®, Astellas Pharma Inc., Chuo-Ku, Tokyo, Japan) was administered orally within 24 h post-surgery, unless clinical complications arose. The initial dose was 0.1 mg/kg/day, divided into two doses daily. Dosage adjustments were made to achieve target trough levels of 10–15 ng/mL during the first 3 months, 5–15 ng/mL up to 12 months, and 5–10 ng/mL thereafter. Immunosuppressant therapy protocol included also mycophenolate (2 g/day), which was withdrawn when possible, and corticoids. Methylprednisolone (10 mg/kg) was administered intravenously during surgery, with the dosage gradually reduced and transitioned to oral prednisolone one week post-transplant. Prednisolone dosage was then tapered and discontinued when clinically feasible.\n\n### 2.3. Tacrolimus measurements\n\nTacrolimus blood concentrations were measured using the ACMIA immunoassay method (Dimension; Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) from whole-blood samples collected 24 h after tacrolimus administration (C_0_, ng/mL) at various follow-up points: 7 and 14 days; 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; and 3, 6, 9, and 36 months. Dose-adjusted trough concentrations (C/D ratio) were calculated by dividing the tacrolimus trough concentration (C_0_) by the corresponding 24-h dose on a mg/kg basis (ng/mL/mg/kg) at each time point.\n\n### 2.4. Single nucleotide polymorphism identification\n\nGenotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was performed using the MassARRAY platform (SEQUENOM, now Agena Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) at the Central Service of Experimental Research Support (SCSIE), Faculty of Medicine, Universitat de València, Spain. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood collected in EDTA tubes from transplant recipients and donors. DNA was purified from 200 μL of blood using the Ultra Clean Blood Spin DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), and the DNA was stored at −20 °C until use. All samples were genotyped in triplicate to ensure the quality of the technique.\n\n### 2.5. SNP panel\n\nThe SNPs evaluated ([Table S1](#appsec1)) were selected based on previous studies associating genes with clinical outcomes in solid organ transplant recipients, along with additional polymorphisms in genes encoding drug transporters and other signaling pathways of potential interest.\n\n### 2.6. Clinical outcomes\n\nSurvival rate was assessed by recording death from any cause during the follow-up period (exitus). Tumor incidence included only de novo tumors that occurred during follow-up. Diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension were diagnosed following standard clinical procedures. Severe infections in transplanted patients were classified as de novo infections. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine levels greater than 0.5 mg/dL or 20–25 % above pre-transplant baseline, coinciding with elevated tacrolimus levels that normalized upon tacrolimus dose reduction. Other causes of renal impairment, such as fever, infection, graft swelling, oliguria, bleeding, dehydration, increased resistive index on Doppler ultrasonography, or ureteral obstruction, were excluded. Renal clearance was calculated using the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) estimated glomerular filtration rate, which accounts for serum creatinine, age, sex, and ethnicity. The CKD-EPI equation, expressed as a single equation, is GFR = 141 × min(Scr/κ, 1)^α^ × max(Scr/κ, 1)^−1.209^ × 0.993^Age^ × 1.018 [if female] x 1.159 [if black], where Scr is serum creatinine, κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is −0.329 for females and −0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and max indicates the maximum of Scr/κ or 1. Chronic cellular kidney rejection was defined according to the Banff consensus, which requires the presence of inflammation in areas of interstitial fibrosis and tubulitis, necessitating biopsy for diagnosis.\n\n### 2.7. Statistical analyses\n\nStatistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 28; IBM, NY, USA). Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of genetic variants with the risk of death (exitus), tumor occurrence, acute and chronic rejection, nephrotoxicity, re-transplantation, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and infections during follow-up. All gene variants were included as variables, with age and gender as covariates. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for clinical outcomes associated with each variant. Survival and tumor incidence were analyzed using logistic regression with stepwise selection and false discovery rate correction in SPSS. The interaction between significant variants located in metabolic and transport pharmacogenes were also studied by logistic regression employing SPSS to determine whether the combination of variants in pairs of genes could alter the risk of clinical events incidence in patients. The time evolution of survival during follow-up, stratified by significant genetic variants, was represented by Kaplan–Meier curves and analyzed using the log-rank test. Renal clearance (CKD-EPI, mL/min/1.73 m^2^) and tacrolimus trough concentrations, adjusted for dose (C/D, ng/mL/mg/kg), were recorded for each patient over the 12-year follow-up. For SNPs showing significant associations with clinical parameters, renal clearance and tacrolimus concentration curves were plotted using Prism v.07 (GraphPad Software®, Boston, MA, USA). Comparisons between patients with different SNP genotypes were made using t-tests for two-allele variants and one-way ANOVA for variants with three genotypes. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant in all analyses. Individual gene variants-clinical parameters associations were represented with Cytoscape software (version 3.10.3; Cytoscape Consortium)\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Pharmacogene variants association with survival\n\nThe potential association between exitus during the follow-up period, regardless of the precise moment, and any of the pharmacogene variants determined was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression, including all variants in the analysis. Different variants in transporter and metabolism genes showed a significant association with the risk of exitus, with the latter being excluded after applying the false discovery rate penalization ([Table 1](#tbl1)). The AA variant in the rs9282564 SNP of the donor's ABCB1 gene was significantly associated (p-value: 0.029) with a reduced risk (OR: 0.116) of exitus during the follow-up period. Conversely, patients receiving a graft from a donor with the GA genotype in rs2273697 of ABCC2 were significantly associated (p-value: 0.021) with an increased risk (OR: 4.133) of exitus.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Exitus | Variant | D/R | Significance |  | OR | OR CI (95 %) |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gene_SNP |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Log Regression | Post FDR | Inferior | Superior |  |  |  |  |\n| ABCB1_rs9282564 | AA | D | 0.021 | 0.029 | 0.116 | 0.019 | 0.726 |\n| ABCC2_rs2273697 | GA | D | 0.016 | 0.021 | 4.133 | 1.301 | 13.125 |\n| CYP2B6_rs3745274 | GT | R | 0.044 | 0.060 | 0.224 | 0.052 | 0.960 |\n| CYP3A5_rs776746 | GG | R | 0.048 | 0.066 | 0.264 | 0.071 | 0.989 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Pharmacogene variants associated with probability of survival during the follow-up.\n\nThe number of patients presenting each genotype of the SNPs associated with exitus and the occurrence of this event is represented in [Table S2](#appsec1) (supplementary material). To confirm the effect of the associated gene variants on patient survival during the 12-year follow-up, Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted. The AG variant in ABCB1 gene rs9282564 of the donor was significantly associated (p-value: 0.042; log-rank) with reduced cumulative survival compared to the AA variant ([Fig. 1](#fig1)A). It was observed that the genotype in the donor's ABCC2 rs2273697 could significantly (p-value: 0.003; log-rank) affect survival ([Fig. 1](#fig1)B), with the GG variant providing a higher rate during the entire follow-up compared to AA and GA. Although the CYP3A5 rs776746 did not show a significant association with survival in logistic regression, the Kaplan-Meier curve was also represented ([Fig. 1](#fig1)C) due to its special relevance and clinical evidence on the response to tacrolimus. No significant difference was observed by log-rank either, but it should not be discarded that the GG variant (∗3/∗3) could offer an advantage, especially at late post-transplantation stages.\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c35a/12319246/5e4c6fbe31f9/gr1.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12319246_gr1.jpg)\n\nKaplan-Meier survival curves with significant differences according to the pharmacogene variants in SNPs associated with exitus. CYP3A5 was also included because of the relevance of the gene in tacrolimus metabolism; although not significant, the GG (∗3/∗3) and GA (∗1/∗3) curves present different behavior. Statistical test: log-rank.\n\n### 3.2. Pharmacogene variants association with tumor incidence\n\nThe association between pharmacogene variants and cancer occurrence, regardless of the exact moment during the 12-year follow-up, was also evaluated ([Table 2](#tbl2)), given the influence that imbalanced immunosuppression could present on tumor control. Multivariate logistic regression using all pharmacogene variants showed that recipients carrying the GT heterozygous genotype in CYP2B6 rs3745275 could present an advantage (OR: 0.099; p-value: 0.048). Conversely, a significant (p-value: 0.043) association with an increased risk (OR: 13.09) of tumor appearance during the follow-up was found in patients receiving a kidney with the AA variant in ABCC2 rs2273697.\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Tumor | Variant | D/R | Significance |  | OR | OR CI (95 %) |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gene_SNP |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Log Regression | Post FDR |   | Inferior | Superior |  |  |  |\n| CYP2B6_rs3745274 | GT | R | 0.035 | 0.048 | 0.099 | 0.012 | 0.850 |\n| ABCC2_rs2273697 | AA | D | 0.032 | 0.043 | 13.091 | 1.241 | 138.105 |\n|   | GA | D | 0.043 | 0.058 | 3.394 | 1.037 | 11.103 |\n| ABCB1_rs9282564 | AA | D | 0.042 | 0.057 | 0.120 | 0.015 | 0.930 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Pharmacogene variants associated with probability of tumor occurrence during the follow-up.\n\nDifferences in population distribution between the presence and absence of cancer during the follow-up, depending on the specific genotype in these SNPs, were also observed ([Table S3](#appsec1); supplementary material).\n\n### 3.3. Pharmacogene variants association with clinical parameters affecting renal function\n\nTo identify associations between pharmacogenes and other clinical parameters affecting kidney function that could arise due to the variable response to administered drugs, multivariate logistic regression was also performed, considering all pharmacogene variants as independent variables and chronic and acute rejection, nephrotoxicity, and re-transplantation as dependent variables. Results are shown in [Table 3](#tbl3), and it can be observed that the GA variant in ABCB1 rs2235013 is associated with a reduced risk of chronic rejection (p-value: 0.016; OR: 0.13). Regarding acute rejection, statistical analysis showed that the CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA variant in the recipient could offer a protective effect (OR: 0.080; p-value: 0.047) compared to other variants at that location. The presence of the TT variant in SLCO1B1 rs4149056 in the recipient and the GT variant in CYP2B6 rs3745274 in the donor were also statistically associated with a reduced risk (OR: 0.16 and 0.2, respectively) of acute rejection. On the contrary, the TA variant in UGT1A9 in rs6714486 of donor showed an association with an increased risk of acute rejection, although the imbalanced distribution of patient genotypes prevents us from considering such a high odds ratio.\n\n### Table 3.\n\n|   | Gene_SNP | Variant | D/R | Significance |  | OR | OR CI (95 %) |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Log Reg | Post FDR |   | Inferior | Superior |  |  |  |\n| Chronic rejection | ABCB1_rs2235013 | GA | D | 0.012 | 0.016 | 0.133 | 0.028 | 0.643 |\n| Acute rejection | CYP3A4_rs2740574 | AA | R | 0.035 | 0.047 | 0.080 | 0.008 | 0.833 |\n| SLCO1B1_rs4149056 | TT | R | 0.018 | 0.024 | 0.157 | 0.034 | 0.725 |  |\n| CYP2B6_rs3745274 | GT | D | 0.020 | 0.027 | 0.199 | 0.051 | 0.777 |  |\n| UGT1A9_rs6714486 | TA | D | 0.015 | 0.020 | 32.116 | 1.952 | 528.327 |  |\n| Nephrotoxicity | SLCO1B1_rs2306283 | AA | R | 0.007 | 0.009 | 0.076 | 0.012 | 0.492 |\n| AG | R | 0.038 | 0.051 | 0.227 | 0.056 | 0.919 |  |  |\n| NOD2_rs2066844 | CC | D | 0.026 | 0.035 | 0.015 | 0.000 | 0.598 |  |\n| SLCO1B1_rs2306283 | AG | D | 0.018 | 0.024 | 0.108 | 0.017 | 0.679 |  |\n| CYP2C19_rs4244285 | AA | D | 0.019 | 0.026 | 11.652 | 1.509 | 89.957 |  |\n| Re-transplantation | TPMT_rs1142345 | AA | D | 0.015 | 0.020 | 0.048 | 0.004 | 0.559 |\n| CYP2C9_rs1799853 | CC | D | 0.031 | 0.042 | 0.102 | 0.013 | 0.810 |  |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Pharmacogene variants associated with the probability of clinical events occurrence regarding renal function during the follow-up.\n\nWhen considering nephrotoxicity, results indicate that the AA and AG variants in SLCO1B1 in the recipient, and the AA variant in this SNP in the donor, were associated with a reduced risk of nephrotoxicity (OR: 0.08, 0.23, and 0.11, respectively). The CC variant in donor NOD2 rs2066844 could also reduce that risk (OR: 0.015). An increased risk of nephrotoxicity was observed in patients receiving grafts carrying the AA variant in CYP2C19 rs4244285. Lastly, a reduced risk of re-transplantation was observed in patients whose implanted kidneys carried the AA variant in TPMT rs1142345 and the CC variant in CYP2C9 rs1799853 (OR: 0.048, p-value: 0.02; and OR: 0.10, p-value: 0.042, respectively). Genotype distribution in patients presenting the different clinical events involved in renal malfunction studied is shown in [Table S4](#appsec1) of supplementary material.\n\n### 3.4. Pharmacogene variants association with other clinical parameters with high Prevalence in transplanted patients\n\nPost-transplant diabetes mellitus is a common occurrence in kidney transplant patients and can be associated with greater mortality, graft failure, and increased risk of infections, also favored by drug-induced immunosuppression. The potential association of higher risk of these clinical side effects with pharmacogene variants was also evaluated ([Table 4](#tbl4)). Genotype distribution in patients presenting diabetes mellitus and infections is shown in [Table S5](#appsec1) (supplementary material). The scheme in [Fig. 2](#fig2) summarizes the pharmacogene variants-clinical parameters associations obtained in the study. This highlights the relevance of different variants that can alter one or more body functions.\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| Clinical parameter | Gene_SNP | Variant | D/R | Significance |  | OR | OR CI (95 %) |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Log Regression | Post FDR |   | Inferior | Superior |  |  |  |  |\n| DM de novo | CYP2B6_rs3745274 | GT | R | 0.056 | 0.056 | 0.273 | 0.072 | 1.033 |\n| Infections | ABCB1_rs1045642 | CC | R | 0.002 | 0.003 | 0.087 | 0.019 | 0.393 |\n| ABCB1_rs9282564 | AA | D | 0.004 | 0.005 | 23.800 | 2.776 | 204.039 |  |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Pharmacogene variants associated with occurrence risk of diabetes mellitus and infections during the follow-up.\n\n### Fig. 2.\n\n![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c35a/12319246/8427de7fa8a1/gr2.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12319246_gr2.jpg)\n\nScheme of significant associations between pharmacogenes variants and the clinical parameters studied.

Effect of pharmacogene variants on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics associated with any clinical parameters studied\n\nDose-adjusted tacrolimus concentration (C/D) was measured in each patient at different time points during the entire follow-up, and the results were compared depending on the variants of each of the SNPs associated with clinical parameters ([Fig. 3](#fig3)). Significantly different concentrations depending on metabolism and active transport (ABCB1) pharmacogenes are presented in [Fig. 3](#fig3)A (left and right panels, respectively). Results show that patients with the AA variant in CYP3A4 rs2740574 (top left graph) have significantly (p-value <0.001) higher dose-adjusted tacrolimus plasma levels (C/D ratio) during the entire follow-up, with a tendency to increase over time, whereas GA variant patients present sustained lower steady levels. This difference reaches up to 2-fold, 200 vs. 100 [(ng/ml)/(mg/kg)] from the 6th year onwards. CYP3A5 is the main enzyme involved in tacrolimus metabolism, and variants have been described to affect the plasma levels of this drug. The ∗3 haplotype, defined by the presence of G instead of A at rs776746, plays an important role, and pharmacogenetics-driven dose adjustment has been established. In this sense, homozygous patients for this variant (∗3/∗3) presented increasing C/D ratios of tacrolimus during the follow-up, reaching levels that exceed 200 [(ng/ml)/(mg/kg)], which was significantly (p-value <0.001) higher than in heterozygous (∗1/∗3) patients, whose levels remained constant around 100 [(ng/ml)/(mg/kg)]. In the case of CYP2C19, it can be observed that the GG and GA variants in donors’ rs4244285 exhibited similar behavior, whereas patients receiving a kidney graft with the AA variant showed higher levels of tacrolimus, especially from 3 years onwards, achieving high C/D values over 300 [(ng/ml)/(mg/kg)] that would suggest the need of dose reduction.\n\n### Fig. 3.\n\n![Fig. 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c35a/12319246/dbeca283a2da/gr3.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12319246_gr3.jpg)\n\nDose-adjusted tacrolimus concentration [(ng/ml)/(mg/kg)] during the follow-up grouped by pharmacogene variants. Statistical test: t-test when there were 2 possible variants; one-way ANOVA for 3 or more.\n\nRegarding active transport pharmacogenes (right panels), only variants in the ABCB1 gene proved significant. Patients with the TT variant in both rs1045642 and rs2235033 SNPs presented significantly (p-value: 0.005 in both cases) higher ratios of tacrolimus C/D than those with any of the other genotype combinations. Patients receiving a kidney graft from a donor with the GG variant in rs2235013 had lower (p-value: 0.011), more sustained dose-adjusted concentrations of the drug, slightly over 100 [(ng/ml)/(mg/kg)]. On the other hand, our results showed ([Fig. 3](#fig3)B) significant differences between variants present in genes encoding passive transport proteins, such as SLCO1B1. In this regard, patients with the TT variant in rs4149056 nearly doubled the dose-adjusted tacrolimus concentration (C/D) observed with TC (p-value: 0.002), with the greatest differences observed from 3 years onwards. When comparing tacrolimus C/D in patients receiving kidney grafts from donors with the AA or GG variant in rs2306283, significant differences (p-value: 0.01) were observed during the early post-transplantation phase, which tended to reduce over time.\n\n### 3.6. Effect of pharmacogene variants associated with any clinical parameters studied on renal function (clearance)\n\nRenal function, based on its clearance capacity, was calculated for each patient at each sampling time during the follow-up. A normal eGFR is greater than 90 ml/min/1.73 m^2^, but values as low as 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2^ are considered normal if there is no other evidence of kidney disease. Thus, the desirable goal is to achieve a minimum estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2^. Patients were grouped based on their SNP variants in pharmacogenes associated with clinical parameters, and their CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) rate of clearance was compared. Statistically significant differences mediated by variants in metabolic ([Fig. 4](#fig4)A) and transport ([Fig. 4](#fig4)B) genes were represented as ml/min/1.73 m^2^. All patients presented very poor function at the time of transplantation, with a renal clearance rate below 10 ml/min/1.73 m^2^. This rate tended to normalize during the first year, reaching around 50–60 ml/min/1.73 m^2^, with different success and time of recovery depending on gene variants. The AA variant in CYP3A4 rs2745074 SNP of recipient mediated better recovery of renal clearance than GA (60 and 45 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively; p-value <0.001), which was observable from 3 months post-transplantation and remained throughout the entire follow-up. Variants ∗3/∗3 in CYP3A5 rs776746 of donor and GT in CYP2B6 rs3745274 of recipient mediated a higher rate of renal clearance than ∗1/∗3 (p-value <0.001) and TT (p-value: 0.018), respectively. In this case, the differences between groups were not observed until 9 and 12 months post-transplantation, respectively. Those patients receiving a kidney graft from a donor carrying the TT variant in the same CYP2B6 SNP (rs3745274) presented delayed and lower recovery of renal function compared to those with the GT variant (p-value: 0.036).\n\n### Fig. 4.\n\n![Fig. 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c35a/12319246/0fd4b9ad7a30/gr4.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12319246_gr4.jpg)\n\nRenal clearance (CKD-EPI) expressed as ml/min/1.73 m2 during the follow-up grouped by pharmacogene variants. Statistical test: t-test when there were 2 only possible variants; one-way ANOVA for 3 or more. Dot lines represent the moment from which the difference appears, and the statistical test is performed.\n\nWhen considering variants present in active transport genes, statistically significant differences were observed in the ABCB1 and ABCC2 genes. CC variants in rs1045642 showed early and more effective recovery, with renal clearance remaining higher than in TC and TT patients, with levels over 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Patients transplanted with organs from donors with GG variants in ABCC2 rs2273697 had better renal clearance throughout the entire follow-up, with differences observed from the first week after transplantation onwards (p-value: 0.039), with sustained levels around 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2^.\n\n### 3.7. Interactions of pharmacogene variants associated with clinical parameters\n\nThe effect of pharmacogenetics interactions on the risk of clinical events occurrence was also studied. The interaction between variants located in genes encoding proteins involved in drug transport and/or metabolism reported significant associations with different clinical outcomes ([Fig. 5](#fig5)). The combination in donor of GG variant in ABCC2 rs2273697 with AG or AA variants in rs4244285 of CYP2C19 metabolizer gene could reduce the risk of tumor occurrence, with an OR < 0.2 in both cases. The combination of some variants in CYP2B6 metabolizer gene with different variants in transporter genes mediated significantly increased risk of clinical events incidence. In this sense, GA variant in rs2279343 of recipient when coinciding with GG variant in ABCC2 rs2273697 of donor could increase the risk of tumor occurrence with a 5.3 odds ratio. The TT variant in recipient rs3745274 of CYP2B6 was also associated with increased risk of graft acute rejection if combined with TC variant in ABCB1 rs1045642 of recipient. If TT gene variant was present in rs3745274 of CYP2B6 in donor, the risk of both nephrotoxicity and DM de novo could increase if concur with TC variant in ABCB1 rs2235033 of recipient or AG variant in SLCO1B1 rs2306283 of donor, respectively (OR: 7.5 and 9.8). The presence of GA variant (∗1/∗3) in CYP3A5 rs776746 of recipient could be associated with increased risk of exitus during the follow-up when coinciding with GA variant in ABCB1 rs2235013 of donor or AG variant in SLCO1B1 rs2306283 of donor (OR: 6.4 in both cases).\n\n### Fig. 5.\n\n![Fig. 5](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c35a/12319246/7a8472fb3002/gr5.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=12319246_gr5.jpg)\n\nScheme of significant associations between pharmacogenes variants interactions and the clinical parameters studied. In each gene variant, R: Recipient and D: Donor; DM: diabetes mellitus; Green lines: reduced risk; Red lines: increased risk; All lines present the same thickness because the OR is below 0.2 (green) o above 5 (red) in all cases; Yellow nodes: variants in metabolizer genes; Blue nodes: variants in transporter genes.\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nIn this study, we assessed the association between pharmacogene variants and clinical parameters using a panel of 37 SNPs from 14 genes—previously reported to influence drug management—in both donors and recipients within a cohort of 79 kidney transplant patients. We examined these associations in relation to the most frequent clinical parameters observed during a 12-year follow-up. Our findings indicate the presence of associations between pharmacogene variants and clinical outcomes, including survival, renal function, and tumor occurrence. Specifically, our results show that: a) 12-year post-transplant survival was associated with variants in both metabolism (CYP3A5 and CYP2B6) and transporter (ABCB1 and ABCC2) genes; b) increased risk of tumor occurrence associated with ABCC2 variants in donors and, conversely, reduced risk was observed in recipients with the GT variant in CYP2B6 rs3745274; c) better recovery of renal function was associated with variants in transporter (ABCB1 and ABCC2) and metabolism (CYP3A5, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6) genes; d) variants in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C19 metabolism genes, as well as ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 transporter genes influenced different tacrolimus pharmacokinetics during follow-up; e) other pharmacogene variants were associated with clinical parameters such as diabetes mellitus and infections.\n\nThe most commonly reported gene-drug interaction in organ transplantation involves the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs776746 A > G in CYP3A5 (which defines the ∗1 and ∗3 haplotypes) and tacrolimus ([Brunet and Pastor-Anglada, 2022](#bib2); [van Gelder et al., 2020](#bib36); [Krall et al., 2021](#bib17); [Genvigir et al., 2020](#bib8)). This interaction has been assigned the highest level of scientific evidence (1A) for metabolism/pharmacokinetics and dosage by the PharmGKB database. The presence of the G variant at this location results in altered mRNA splicing, leading to a premature stop codon and the production of a non-functional CYP3A5 protein ([Urzì Brancati et al., 2022](#bib35)). Patients with the ∗3/∗3 haplotype, known as non-expressers, exhibit increased tacrolimus concentrations due to impaired drug metabolism. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) have issued dosing recommendations based on CYP3A5 haplotypes, advising a starting dose 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher than the standard dose for ∗1/∗3 (intermediate metabolizers) and ∗1/∗1 (extensive metabolizers) patients, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, the CYP3A4 ∗1B variant (rs2740574) has been associated with enhanced CYP3A4 activity, and carriers of this variant exhibit a lower tacrolimus dose-adjusted concentration ratio (C/D) compared to CYP3A4 ∗1/∗1 patients ([Degraeve et al., 2020](#bib6); [Šimičević et al., 2022](#bib32)). Variants in other genes involved in the pharmacokinetics of drugs used in solid organ transplantation, such as ABCB1, ABCC2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A9, have also been associated with tacrolimus metabolism ([Urzì Brancati et al., 2022](#bib35)), although their relationships with immunosuppressive drugs are less consistent. These genes may also play a role in the metabolism of other medications used in transplantation settings. Regarding ABCB1, it encodes an ATP-dependent efflux pump that mediates the excretion of tacrolimus and its metabolites into urine, promoting drug clearance ([Degraeve et al., 2020](#bib6)). Decreased expression or function of this protein due to pharmacogene variants, such as rs1045642 and rs9282564, can affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and has been associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity ([Tziastoudi et al., 2021](#bib34); [Hawwa et al., 2009](#bib10)), although discrepant results have been reported. Moreover, the risk of graft rejection has been linked to rs1045642 and rs2032582 SNPs in ABCB1 ([Korkor et al., 2023](#bib16)). ABCC2 may also be involved in tacrolimus transport, as the rs3740066 SNP has been shown to significantly increase dose-normalized tacrolimus concentrations, whereas rs717620 had no significant effect ([Li et al., 2011](#bib19)). However, long-term studies on these associations are lacking. Variants in UGT1A9 (rs72551330, rs3832043, rs6714486, and rs17868320) have been associated with mycophenolate mofetil toxicity and efficacy in kidney transplantation ([Krall et al., 2021](#bib17)), although the clinical evidence remains low (levels 3 and 4). Associations between CYP2C19 (∗2, rs4244285) and increased hospital stays in kidney transplant patients treated with tacrolimus have been reported (evidence level 3) ([Bosó et al., 2013](#bib1)), although this finding has not been confirmed. The CC variant in the NOD2 gene has also been associated with prolonged hospital stays ([Bosó et al., 2013](#bib1)). To date, no associations between clinical events and variants in genes such as CYP2B6, SLCO1B1, and CYP2C9 have been reported. It is important to note that long-term studies on the impact of pharmacogenetic variants on the outcomes of transplant patients are still lacking.\n\nGiven the frequent comorbidities in transplanted patients, their survival rates are often reduced. We evaluated the association between the risk of exitus during follow-up (and its timing) and the gene variants included in our panel. Logistic regression analysis revealed that variants in four SNPs of ABCB1, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, and ABCC2 genes were associated with altered risk of death from any cause after 12 years. However, after applying false discovery rate (FDR) penalization, only variants in donors' ABCB1 and ABCC2 genes remained significantly associated with reduced (OR: 0.116) and increased (OR: 4.133) risk, respectively. While these variants have been previously linked with tacrolimus, none of the ABCB1 SNPs had robust scientific evidence of drug effects (levels of evidence 3 and 4 in PharmGKB©). Kaplan-Meier analysis of variants significantly associated with survival showed that only ABCB1 rs9282564 (log-rank: 0.042) and ABCC2 rs2273697 (log-rank: 0.005) in donors had significant differences in survival rates. To evaluate the effect of CYP3A5 rs776746, a frequently associated variant with tacrolimus, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed on our cohort subdivided into ∗1/∗3 and ∗3/∗3 CYP3A5 haplotypes. We did not observe statistically significant differences (log-rank: 0.138) between haplotypes; however, CYP3A5 ∗1/∗3 recipients had reduced survival probability compared with ∗3/∗3 patients in the later stages of follow-up, suggesting a potential long-term effect on patient outcomes.\n\nRegarding tumor occurrence, our results indicate that the GT variant in CYP2B6 rs3745274 in recipients was statistically associated with an increased risk of tumor incidence during follow-up (p-value: 0.048). Conversely, this variant was also associated with a reduced risk of diabetes mellitus occurrence (p-value: 0.056). However, we did not find strong evidence linking CYP2B6 variants with drug use in transplantation or short-term cancer risk studies.\n\nRenal dysfunction is commonly reported in organ-transplanted patients, which can result from graft rejection or the effects of administered treatments, particularly tacrolimus, known to cause nephrotoxicity in some patients with elevated blood concentrations of drug ([Knops et al., 2023](#bib15); [Sallustio et al., 2021](#bib29)). These elevated levels may arise from incorrect dosing or individual variations in drug metabolism and excretion. We assessed the potential association of pharmacogene variants with clinical parameters affecting renal function, including nephrotoxicity, graft rejection, and the need for re-transplantation. Our results indicate that the ABCB1 gene could influence the risk of chronic rejection (GA variant in donor's rs2235013 SNP; OR: 0.13) and severe infections, either reducing it (CC variant in recipient's ABCB1 rs1045642; OR: 0.087) or increasing it (AA variant in donor's ABCB1 rs9282564; OR: 23.8). Acute rejection was associated with variants in CYP3A4, CYP2B6, UGT1A9 metabolism genes (with CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 having protective roles and UGT1A9 increasing risk), and the SLCO1B1 transporter gene, where the TT variant in recipient rs4149056 showed a reduced risk of acute rejection (OR: 0.157). Regarding the need for re-transplantation, variants in TPMT and CYP2C9 genes were associated with a protective role, though we could not determine the underlying rationale in the literature.\n\nThe AA (TT) variant in CYP3A4 rs2740574 has been previously associated with increased tacrolimus concentration/dose (C/D) ([Kuypers et al., 2007](#bib18); [Hannachi et al., 2021](#bib9)), which aligns with our findings of significantly higher (p-value <0.001) C/D in AA recipients. This may account for reduced immune activity and decreased rejection risk. CYP3A5 ∗3 haplotype has also been associated with increased dose-adjusted tacrolimus concentrations ([Contreras-Castillo et al., 2021](#bib4); [Cheng et al., 2022](#bib3)), consistent with our observations. Recipients with the TT variant in SLCO1B1 rs4149056 showed higher dose-adjusted tacrolimus concentrations, possibly mediating a greater immunosuppressive effect and protecting against rejection, consistent with our logistic regression results (OR: 0.157). Although a previous study did not find significant effects on tacrolimus concentrations ([Oetting et al., 2018](#bib27)), we observed significantly sustained lower dose-adjusted tacrolimus concentrations over time in patients receiving grafts from donors with the AAgenotype in this SNP, supporting the protective role against nephrotoxicity. Indeed, the AA variant in this SNP in both recipient and donor patients significantly reduced ([Table 3](#tbl3)) the risk of nephrotoxicity (OR: 0.076 and 0.108, respectively). On the other hand, the CC variant in NOD2 rs2066844 in donor also showed a reduced risk of nephrotoxicity, although no significant effect was observed on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. A previous work ([Bosó et al., 2013](#bib1)) reported a significant association of this variant with increased hospital stay. Our study also found a strong association (p-value: 0.026) with a substantial increase in nephrotoxicity risk (OR: 11.6) in patients with the AA variant in CYP2C19 rs4244285, which defines the ∗2 poor metabolizer haplotype and has been reported ([Huang et al., 2022](#bib12)) to require lower tacrolimus doses for therapeutic concentrations. Our results confirm this, with significantly higher (p-value: 0.026) dose-adjusted tacrolimus concentrations (over 300 [(ng/ml)/(mg/kg)]) observed in patients receiving a kidney with this variant, which could contribute to nephrotoxicity. CYP2C19 metabolizes omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor used by all patients in our cohort, and pharmacogenetics in this gene can alter its pharmacokinetics ([Román et al., 2014](#bib28)). The ∗2 allele (A variant in rs4244285) reduces its metabolizing efficacy, and our group previously reported ([Bosó et al., 2013](#bib1)) that patients with the AA genotype in CYP2C19 rs4244285 required prolonged hospital stays post-transplantation. This blocks omeprazole metabolism by CYP2C19, making it a substrate for CYP3A5, which competes with tacrolimus, leading to its inefficient metabolism and accumulation in the body. Thus, evaluating not only direct pharmacogene-drug associations but also drug-pharmacogene-drug and pharmacogene-pharmacogene-drug interactions is crucial. In this sense, the pharmacogenes interactions were also analyzed in this work since these could improve the predictive perspective of pharmacogenetics and relevant associations were found.\n\nGene variants that already proved direct association with exitus risk and with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and renal clearance alteration (CYP3A5 rs776746) also showed interactions with variants in SLCO1B1 (rs2306283) and ABCB1 (rs2235013) that increased this risk of exitus. Other genes with direct association with tumor, exitus risk and renal clearance (CYP2B6 and ABCC2) also proved interactions with variants in other genes that significantly associated with increased risk of acute rejection, nephrotoxicity (both with ABCB1 variants, which were also proved to alter tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and renal clearance by themselves). The latter also occurred in DM de novo but with SLCO1B1 variants, which were associated with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics changes. These results support the idea that pharmacogenes interactions can play a significant role in the predictive perspective of pharmacogenetics studies. Genotyping patients with a comprehensive pharmacogenetics panels and following their long-term outcomes has highlighted associations with clinical events that may emerge later, as previously observed in our liver transplantation cohort ([Sendra et al., 2022](#bib30)). While larger validation studies are needed to confirm these results, pharmacogenetic testing could provide valuable information for clinicians to improve pharmacotherapy management ([Lloberas et al., 2023](#bib21); [Vidal-Alabró et al., 2024](#bib37)) and the clinicians’ predictive accuracy.\n\nIt must be taken into account that the long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs following kidney transplantation increases the risk of malignancies, life-threatening infections, nephrotoxicity, and, paradoxically, eventual allograft rejection. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to achieve a balance between over- and under-immunosuppression by modulating immune responses through various approaches, including antibody-based therapies, as well as cell and gene therapies. Antibody-based therapies focus on blocking co-stimulatory immune activation signals. For instance, Belatacept, a fusion protein targeting CD80 and CD86, inhibits the entire co-stimulation pathway mediated by CD28 or CTLA4 ([Noble et al., 2025](#bib26)). Alternatively, VEL-101, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD28, offers a more specific and controlled modulation of T cell activation ([Khan et al., 2025](#bib14)). Genetic variants in these targets and associated pathways should be considered when selecting the most appropriate therapeutic regimen. In this context, polymorphisms in the IL10 gene—which encodes a key cytokine involved in immunomodulatory processes—have been associated with variable tumor susceptibility ([Li et al., 2022](#bib20)). Understanding these genetic variants facilitates the development of personalized advanced therapies, including both cell- and gene-based strategies. In terms of cell therapy, the use of regulatory T cells (Tregs) ([Matarneh et al., 2025](#bib22)), which play a central role in maintaining immune tolerance, and regulatory B cells (Bregs) ([McNee et al., 2025](#bib24)), which contribute to allograft protection, has shown promising results in transplantation studies. Regarding gene therapy, our group proposed a model for the ex vivo transfer of the human IL10 gene to liver grafts in a porcine model ([Sendra et al., 2024](#bib31)). This was achieved using non-viral hydrodynamic injection during back-table surgery, prior to implantation. The procedure was demonstrated to be safe, and the overall results support its potential clinical relevance.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings in this work suggest that variants in genes encoding proteins involved in drug metabolism and transportation may be associated with clinical parameters of high incidence in transplant recipients. Our results confirm that variants in CYP3A5 affect tacrolimus pharmacokinetics that could require dose adjustment, as widely reported. We also found significantly increased risk of exitus during the follow-up through a direct association, which was even enhanced through the interaction of CYP3A5 with specific variants in ABCB1 and SLCO1B1 transporter genes. Contrarily, although CYP2B6 has not been previously associated with transplantation clinical events, in our cohort, some variants were found to alter the renal clearance and increase the risk of exitus, tumor, acute rejection and DM occurrence during the 12-year follow-up, which were enhanced if coincided with variants in ABCC2, SLCO1B1 and ABCC2 transporter genes. Thus, identifying gene multiple variants with panels would favor the predictive potential of pharmacogenetics and help clinicians to optimize personalized pharmacotherapy.\n\n## 5. Study limitations\n\nThis study presents data from a very long-term follow-up of kidney transplant recipients, which has been done only rarely. However, the cohort size is limited, and all patients were transplanted and followed at a single center. Therefore, further multicenter studies with larger cohorts and greater genetic diversity are needed to validate the findings reported in this paper.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Luis Sendra:** Software, Methodology, Investigation, Writing – original draft. **Gladys G.

Cases had disease recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, second non-breast cancer, or died. For each case, controls were identified from the same treatment arm of similar age, surgery/radiation, and TNM stage.

In Arm A during the first 5 years of therapy, women with 2 poor alleles (PM/PM: OR=2.45, 95% CI: 1.05–5.73, p=0.04) and women with one poor allele (PM/IM or PM/EM: OR=1.67, 95% CI: 0.95–2.93, p=0.07) had a higher likelihood of an event than women with two extensive alleles (EM/EM). In years 3–5 when patients remained on tamoxifen (Arm A) or switched to anastrozole (Arm B), PM/PM tended towards a higher likelihood of a disease event relative to EM/EM (OR= 2.40, 95% CI: 0.86–6.66, p=0.09) among women on Arm A but not among women on Arm B (OR= 0.28; 95% CI: 0.03–2.30).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn ABCSG8, the negative effects of reduced CYP2D6 metabolism were observed only during the period of tamoxifen administration, and not after switching to anastrozole.\n\n## Background\n\nIn the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer, 5 years of an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or a sequencing regimen of 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 3 years of an AI significantly prolongs disease free survival (DFS) compared to 5 years of tamoxifen ([1](#R1)). Based on these data, practice guidelines recommend either an AI for 5 years, or the sequence of tamoxifen followed by an AI ([2](#R2)).\n\nTamoxifen is a weak anti-estrogen with agonistic properties that is extensively metabolized into potent anti-estrogens, 4-hydroxy tamoxifen and endoxifen, which exhibit similar potency in terms of binding affinity to ERs ([3](#R3)), suppression of estradiol-stimulated cell proliferation ([4](#R4)) and gene expression ([3](#R3)). Endoxifen is formed by the CYP2D6-mediated oxidation of n-desmethyl tamoxifen ([4](#R4), [5](#R5)). Common genetic variations in CYP2D6 and/or drug-induced inhibition of CYP2D6 enzyme activity are associated with significant reductions in endoxifen concentrations in tamoxifen treated humans ([6](#R6)–[8](#R8)). These data led to the hypothesis that CYP2D6 variation may affect the clinical outcomes of women treated with tamoxifen but not anastrozole, since CYP3A and not CYP2D6 is the major P450 isoform involved in the metabolism of anastrozole ([9](#R9)).\n\nThere has been great heterogeneity with regard to the reported association between CYP2D6 metabolism and clinical outcomes. Retrospective data from a randomized clinical trial of women treated with tamoxifen monotherapy for early stage ER positive breast cancer (NCCTG 89-30-52) ([10](#R10)), a pooled analysis of the women from NCCTG 89-30-52 and a respective German cohort ([11](#R11)) and other reports (reviewed in ([12](#R12))) have demonstrated an association between *CYP2D6* genotype and disease-free survival (DFS). However, multiple other reports have not demonstrated an association (reviewed in ([12](#R12))) including a recent analyses of a subset of patients enrolled in two prospective adjuvant clinical trials, ATAC and BIG 1-98 ([13](#R13), [14](#R14)). However, concern has been raised ([15](#R15)) given the observation of substantial departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for the most important *CYP2D6* allele, **4* in both studies ([13](#R13),[14](#R14)) Moreover, a review evaluating published studies found large between-study variability in the classification of genotypes and choice of primary endpoint as well as substantial methodological shortcomings leading to inconsistencies in study conclusions ([16](#R16)). Therefore, we sought to obtain independent determination whether the odds of a disease event differs by *CYP2D6* genotype in women with early stage ER positive breast cancer who received 5 years of tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy by performing a secondary analysis of a large prospective tamoxifen study. We also aimed to determine the relationship between *CYP2D6* genotype and outcomes in women receiving 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 3 years of anastrozole.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Patients\n\nThe source of patients was the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Study 8 (ABCSG trial 8, [NCT00291759](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00291759)), a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open label trial that randomized 3,901 surgically resected early stage breast cancer patients within 6 weeks after surgery to either 5 years of tamoxifen (20 mg/daily) or to 2 years of tamoxifen (20 mg/daily) followed by a switch to anastrozole (1 mg/day) for 3 years ([17](#R17)). Eligible patients were postmenopausal women aged 80 years or younger with histologically verified ductal or lobular breast carcinoma that was invasive or minimally invasive, endocrine-responsive, and Nottingham grade 1 or grade 2. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), hormone therapy (HT), or radiotherapy (RT) was not allowed. Patients underwent modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery with axillary lymph-node dissection or sentinel lymph-node biopsy (with or without subsequent RT). None of the patients received adjuvant CT. All patients provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The pharmacogenetics substudy was approved by the relevant ethics committees in Austria and the United States.\n\n#### Sample Preparation\n\nTo overcome the potential problems related to somatic deletion of the CYP2D6 chromosomal locus on 22q13 ([18](#R18), [19](#R19)), three unmounted whole tissue sections (10-μm thick) derived from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks containing both normal and tumor tissue were prepared. One hematoxylin and eosin slide was also obtained to confirm tissue cellularity. From the unmounted whole sections, the tissue was deparaffinized, and DNA extracted using the modified method of Schroth et al ([11](#R11)).\n\n#### Assay methods\n\nDNA was assessed for the most common CYP2D6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) corresponding to alleles associated with null [*3 (2549 del A),*4(1846G>A), and *6(1707T>del)] reduced [*10 (100 C>T and 1846 G>A) and *41 (2988 G>A)] CYP2D6 enzyme activity as previously described ([11](#R11)) using the Applied Biosystems’ Taqman® Allelic Discrimination Assay (Foster City, CA) with the ABI Prism 7900HT Real Time System according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To ensure that non-specific amplification was not misinterpreted, the amplification plots were evaluated in addition to the end-point allelic discrimination plots. Two of the three triplicate reactions must concur and data derived from amplification beyond 45 cycles was not utilized. Samples from the Coriell Institute with known genotypes for each SNP and each possible allele combination (when available) were included on every plate and evaluated along with the unknown genotype samples. The presence of the alleles in the Coriell samples were confirmed by sequencing with validated methods that meet Hardy Weinberg equilibrium standards. The real-time methods were validated against the previously validated PCR and sequencing methods. A pooled DNA sample from ABI was also used in a standard curve to estimate the level of SNP detection for each run. The CYP2D6 *5 gene deletion allele and duplicated alleles could not be assessed because of DNA fragmentation which results from paraffin fixation.\n\n### CYP2D6 metabolism definition\n\nCYP2D6 phenotype groups were defined as previously published ([11](#R11)) where ‘extensive’ metabolizers do not carry a null or reduced allele (EM/EM); those with one to two reduced alleles without a null allele (EM/IM, IM/IM); one null allele (PM/IM, PM/EM), and ‘poor’ metabolizers, those with 2 null alleles (PM/PM). Information regarding use of CYP2D6 inhibitors was unknown; however, the use of CYP2D6 inhibitors for the treatment of hot flashes was not recommended during the period of study enrollment on ABCSG 8.\n\n### Study Design and Analysis Plan\n\nA matched case control study was conducted to examine whether the odds of a disease event differed with respect to *CYP2D6* genotype. The definitions of a case and a control take into account the early release of the trial results in 2005 ([17](#R17)) as well as the opening of ABCSG 16 [Secondary Adjuvant Long-Term Study With Arimidex; (SALSA); [NCT00295620](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00295620)]. That is, time at risk for a disease event was truncated at the date of switch to anastrozole for those women on Arm A who elected to switch from tamoxifen to anastrozole following the release the publication of the combined ABCSG-8/ARNO95 analysis ([17](#R17)). For other patients, events after 5 years of therapy were not eligible for analysis given that ABCSG 8 patients either enrolled onto ABCSG 16 or information regarding extended adjuvant hormonal therapy after 5 years was not collected. This analysis plan was consistent with the approach in the published parent ABCSG8 trial ([20](#R20)). Using the definition of invasive disease free survival by Hudis et al ([21](#R21)), a case was defined as a woman who had a documented local, regional, or distant recurrence of breast cancer; a contralateral breast cancer, or a 2^nd^ non-breast primary cancer or died from any cause during her time at risk. For a given case, two controls were selected using an optimal matching ([22](#R22), [23](#R23)) from among women randomized to the same treatment arm whose age at randomization was within 5 years for the case; whose primary treatment (modified radical mastectomy +/− radiation therapy [RT] or breast conserving surgery [BCS] + RT versus BCS alone), tumor stage (I versus II/III), nodal status (positive versus negative) was the same as the case; and whose time at risk was longer than that of the case. In some situations, only one control was available for the case, either because matching criteria could not be met or adequate tissue was not available for genotyping of selected controls.\n\nConditional logistic regression modeling (CLRM) for matched triplets and pairs was used to examine whether the odds of a disease event differed with respect to CYP2D6 genotype in the following situations: 1) the first 5 years of treatment, for each arm separately 2) years 3–5 of treatment, for each arm separately, 3) in the first 2 years of treatment, (when all patients were assigned tamoxifen). Two-sided P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Analysis was performed using SAS (Version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Assuming that 5% of the controls would be poor CYP2D6 metabolizers and the number of disease events would be 200, a two-sided alpha=0.05 chi-square test for the 2 to 1 matched odds ratio would have a 80% power for detecting an odds ratio of 2.5 or greater.\n\n## Results\n\n### Characteristics of the Patients\n\nOf the 3,901 women enrolled in ABCSG 8, 1849 eligible patients were randomized to tamoxifen (Arm A) and 1865 eligible patients were randomized to the tamoxifen followed by anastrozole (Arm B) There were 790 patients from Arm A and 799 patients from Arm B with tissue blocks available. There were 354 patients with a disease event and 1235 potential controls among these 1589 patients. However, 12 cases from Arm A had an event after switching to anastrozole following early release of ABCSG 8 results ([17](#R17)) and as such were ineligible. Of the remaining 342 cases, 23 (6.7%) cases were excluded from the analysis due to insufficient tissue in the block (9 cases) and unable to find a suitable control with adequate tissue (14 cases) ([Figure 1](#F1)). Thus, 319 cases were matched to 557 matched controls (2 controls/case for 238 cases and 1 control/case for 81 cases). The number of cases eligible for analysis based on therapy period (years 1–2, 3–5) are given in [Table 3](#T3). Cases occurring after the first 5 years of therapy were not eligible for analysis as outlined above. The breakdown of the type of disease events is given in [Table 1](#T1) and the characteristics of the cases and controls overall and by treatment arm are given in [Table 2](#T2).\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/67ca/3548984/abe3120a40d4/nihms426261f1.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3548984_nihms426261f1.jpg)\n\nConsort diagram\n\n### Table 3.\n\n|   | Within 2 Years | Years 3–5 | Within 5 Years | After Year 5* | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arm A | 28 | 84 | 112 | 54 | 166 |\n| Arm B | 41 | 61 | 102 | 51 | 153 |\n| Total | 69 | 145 | 214 | 105 | 319 |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Number of cases analyzed in specific follow-up time periods relative to drug therapy\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Event N (%) |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local recurrence1 | 41 (12.9) |\n| Distant recurrence1,2 | 90 (28.2) |\n| Contralateral cancer | 28 (8.8) |\n| Second primary2 | 91 (28.5) |\n| Death | 78 (24.5) |\n\nTable 1 Caption: First events among 319 cases.\n\n### Table 2.\n\n|   | Arm A |  | Arm B |  | Overall |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Cases | Controls | Cases | Controls | Cases | Controls |\n|   | n = 166 | n = 287 | n = 153 | n = 270 | n = 319 | n = 557 |\n| Age, years, median (range) | 66 (49–80) | 66 (48–80) | 69 (49–80) | 67 (47–79) | 68 (49–80) | 66 (47–80) |\n| Treatment, n (%) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| BCS without RT | 29 (17.5) | 45 (15.7) | 25 (16.3) | 45 (16.7) | 54 (16.9) | 90 (16.2) |\n| BCS with RT | 95 (57.2) | 186 (64.8) | 90 (58.8) | 171 (63.3) | 185 (58.0) | 357 (64.1) |\n| Mastectomy without RT | 39 (23.5) | 52 (18.1) | 35 (22.9) | 47 (17.4) | 74 (23.2) | 99 (17.8) |\n| Mastectomy with RT | 3 (1.8) | 4 (1.4) | 3 (2.0) | 7 (2.6) | 6 (1.9) | 11 (2.0) |\n| Tumor stage, n (%) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| I | 102 (61.4) | 181 (63.1) | 94 (61.4) | 165 (61.1) | 196 (61.4) | 346 (62.1) |\n| II/III | 64 (38.6) | 106 (36.9) | 59 (38.6) | 105 (38.9) | 123 (38.6) | 211 (37.9) |\n| Node status, n (%) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Positive | 66 (39.8) | 108 (37.6) | 56 (36.6) | 93 (34.4) | 122 (38.2) | 201 (36.1) |\n| Negative | 100 (60.2) | 179 (62.4) | 97 (63.4) | 177 (65.6) | 197 (61.8) | 356 (63.9) |\n| Grade, n (%) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| I | 29 (18.7) | 64 (24.3) | 29 (20.9) | 65 (27.1) | 58 (19.7) | 129 (25.6) |\n| II | 126 (81.3) | 199 (75.7) | 110 (79.1) | 175 (72.9) | 236 (80.3) | 374 (74.4) |\n| Unknown | 11 | 24 | 14 | 30 | 25 | 54 |\n| Her2 status, n (%) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Positive | 13 (8.1) | 16 (5.8) | 9 (6.1) | 16 (6.1) | 22 (7.2) | 32 (5.9) |\n| Negative | 147 (91.9) | 262 (94.2) | 138 (93.9) | 248 (93.9) | 285 (92.8) | 510 (94.1) |\n| Unknown | 6 | 9 | 6 | 6 | 12 | 15 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Characteristics of the cases and controls\n\n#### Genotype and allele frequency\n\nThe five *CYP2D6* SNPs associated with the CYP2D6 alleles: *4, *6, *10, and *41, and the *CYP2D6* *3 SNP were genotyped with a success rate of greater than 98% and 84%, respectively.

There were a limited number of events during years 1–2 ([Table 3](#T3)); however, a similar non-significant higher odds of a disease event was observed for PM/PM relative to EM/EM in the first 2 years of tamoxifen for both arms: Arm A: OR = 2.54, p = 0.25 and Arm B: OR = 2.60, p = 0.46.\n\nDuring years 3–5, for women on Arm A who remained event free during the first 2 years of tamoxifen therapy, PM/PM (OR 2.40, 95% CI: 0.86 to 6.66, p = 0.09) and IM/PM or EM/PM (OR 1.70, 95% CI: 0.91–3.17, p=0.09) had a trend towards an increased odds of a disease event relative to EM/EM. In contrast, women on Arm B who remained event-free during the first 2 years of tamoxifen, the odds of disease event for PM/PM (OR 0.28, p = 0.23) and the IM/PM or EM/PM group (OR 0.63, p = 0.22) were found to be non-significantly decreased during years 3–5 relative to EM/EM.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAmong the post-menopausal women with ER positive breast cancer enrolled on ABCSG 8 who were randomized to 5 years of tamoxifen (Arm A), there was a significantly higher odds of a disease event for those with CYP2D6 PM/PM phenotype relative to those with the CYP2D6 EM/EM phenotype, but this was not observed in patients treated with anastrozole following tamoxifen (Arm B). Moreover, in Arm A, there was a strong trend towards a higher likelihood of a disease event (relative to EM/EM phenotype) in those that carried at least one poor allele (PM/IM and PM/EM), but not for patients without poor alleles (IM/IM and EM/IM). Because of the small number of patients with the IM/IM phenotype, no conclusions can be drawn regarding this group. The overall findings are consistent with pharmacokinetic data demonstrating a stepwise reduction in endoxifen concentrations based on number of PM alleles ([8](#R8)).\n\nFor ABCSG 8 patients randomized to 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 3 years of anastrozole (Arm B), *CYP2D6* genotype was not associated with the odds of a disease event. However, breaking the treatment period into the tamoxifen phase and the anastrozole phase, we found non-significant higher odds of a disease event among PM/PM relative to EM/EM in the first 2 years of tamoxifen similar to Arm A but no evidence of significantly increased odds of a disease event during anastrozole treatment in years 3–5 for PM/PM phenotype relative to EM/EM phenotype. These data suggest that AI use following tamoxifen negates or even reverses the higher likelihood of disease recurrence observed in patients with reduced CYP2D6 metabolism. The observation that reduced metabolism is detrimental only during the period of tamoxifen administration may explain some of the controversy surrounding *CYP2D6* genotype and tamoxifen efficacy, given that switching from tamoxifen to an AI is recommended ([24](#R24)). While early studies (prior to the routine use of AIs following tamoxifen) demonstrated an association between CYP2D6 and tamoxifen efficacy ([11](#R11), [25](#R25)) multiple recent studies have been negative ([26](#R26)–[28](#R28)). However, a major concern of the negative studies is the lack of assurance that the confounding impact of a switch to an AI was adequately considered.\n\nSimon et al have proposed a refined system for biomarker studies that incorporates a hierarchal level of evidence scale for tumor marker studies using archived specimens ([29](#R29)). This “prospective-retrospective” design stipulates that the clinical and pathologic characteristics of patients in the biomarker study be representative of patients in the parent trial and that a sufficient number of patients with archived tissue be included for adequate statistical power. Notably the ATAC *CYP2D6* analysis included 588 (18.9%) of the 3116 women randomized to tamoxifen and the clinical characteristics of genotyped patients differed significantly (p<0.005) in multiple important clinical characteristics (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone receptor status), both compared with non-genotyped UK patients and rest of the world patients. Furthermore, only 89 (17%) of the 535 distant recurrences were included in the tamoxifen *CYP2D6* analysis. Given the variants genotyped in ATAC, Schroth et al estimated that more than 1200 patients would be required to detect a hazard ratio of 1.85 between CYP2D6 poor (PM) and extensive metabolizer (EM) with 90% power ([11](#R11)). Therefore, the ATAC clinical analysis of *CYP2D6* was neither representative of the entire population nor adequately powered.\n\nIn contrast to ATAC, the ABCSG 8 analysis of *CYP2D6* included 52% (214/408) of all first events occurring during the first 5 years ([20](#R20)). Our analysis plan was to match cases to two controls from a pool of 1235 ABCSG patients who did not have a disease event based on known prognostic factors and exposure time in order to increase the power to detect a smaller odds ratio. Because our study design focused on early events occurring during the period of drug administration (years 1–5), an unanswered question remains whether alterations in CYP2D6 metabolism affect the risk of late recurrences (after tamoxifen discontinuation).\n\nSimon et al additionally propose that for a “retrospective-prospective” design, the biomarker assay must be analytically and pre-analytically validated for use with archived tissues ([29](#R29)). CYP2D6 enzyme activity (and therefore endoxifen concentrations) results from both *CYP2D6* germ-line variation, and the potency and duration of CYP2D6 inhibitors co-administered with tamoxifen. A limitation of this and other prospective clinical trials evaluating tamoxifen is that germ-line DNA was never collected, and information regarding concomitant medications is unknown. Because paraffin embedded tumors blocks which contain normal tissue are often collected, germline DNA may be extracted and used for genotyping. However, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) involving chromosome 22q13.1, the location of the CYP2D6 gene ([18](#R18), [19](#R19)) has been noted in ER positive tumors. Therefore, it is critical to assess for HWE, which states that both allele and genotype frequencies in a population remain constant assuming no new mutations, no selection, and random mating. Substantial departure from HWE may point to genotyping error or other biases. Notably, the BIG1-98 utilized tumor cores for *CYP2D6* genotyping and demonstrated marked deviation from HWE for nearly all CYP2D6 alleles, including the most important *CYP2D6* variant (*4) (HWE: p=10^−91^).\n\nWithin the ABCSG 8 cohort, in order to obtain sufficient numbers of normal epithelial cells for the detection of germline genotypes, we extracted DNA from tissue sections that contained both normal and tumor tissue, and the *4, *6, and *10 alleles were within HWE. However, moderate deviation was observed for the rare *3 allele, as well as reduced metabolism alleles ([Table 4](#T4)). The latter observation may relate to somatic deletion of the CYP2D6 chromosomal locus ([18](#R18), [19](#R19)) or the presence of germline deletion of the entire CYP2D6 gene *(CYP2D6 *5)* ([30](#R30)), leading to a deficit of observed heterozygotes. It should be noted, however, that the measured allele frequencies in this study were similar to previously published data from other European Caucasian populations (PharmGKB [http://www.pharmgkb.org/index.jsp](http://www.pharmgkb.org/index.jsp)).\n\nPrior studies evaluating the importance of adherence have indicated higher rates of non-adherence in patients without close follow-up([31](#R31)) as well as in younger patients (< age 45) ([32](#R32)). While adherence was not formally monitored, ABCSG 8 enrolled postmenopausal women with a median age of and regular follow-up visits were required.\n\nIn summary, in the ABCSG 8 clinical trial, the CYP2D6 PM/PM phenotype was associated with a higher likelihood of an early disease event in women treated with 5 years of tamoxifen, but not in patients treated with sequential tamoxifen followed by anastrozole. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether altering the dose, the duration, or choice of adjuvant hormonal therapy based on *CYP2D6* genotype or the pharmacological monitoring of endoxifen levels will improve the clinical outcomes of postmenopausal women with early stage ER positive breast cancer.\n\nThere is controversy whether the efficacy of tamoxifen is altered in women with genetic or drug-induced alterations in CYP2D6, the rate limiting enzyme responsible for the metabolism of tamoxifen to its active metabolite, endoxifen. Whereas many negative studies have evaluated CYP2D6 polymorphisms in patients with a history of tamoxifen use, data from ABCSG 8 demonstrate that variation in CYP2D6 metabolism is associated with a higher risk of recurrence only during the period of tamoxifen administration, and not after switching to anastrozole. These data suggest that future studies should prospectively evaluate novel strategies to overcome the limitations of CYP2D6 metabolism, including the direct administration of endoxifen\n\nThere is controversy whether the efficacy of tamoxifen is altered in women with genetic or drug-induced alterations in CYP2D6, the rate limiting enzyme responsible for the metabolism of tamoxifen to its active metabolite, endoxifen.

    "article_text": "# Effect of NLRP3 inflammasome genes polymorphism on disease susceptibility and response to TNF-α inhibitors in Iraqi patients with rheumatoid arthritis\n\n## Metadata\n**Authors:** Abdullah Abbas Awni, Zainab Oday Hamed, Ahmed Abdul-Hassan Abbas, Ahmed Sahib Abdulamir\n**Journal:** Heliyon\n**Date:** 2023 Jun 1\n**DOI:** [10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16814](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16814)\n**PMID:** 37332933\n**PMCID:** PMC10275785\n**URL:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10275785/\n**PDF:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10275785/pdf/main.pdf](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10275785/pdf/main.pdf)\n\n## Abstract\n\n**Background:** \nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a genetically predisposed, systemic, chronic, inflammatory disease. Immune system dysregulation and inherited susceptibility polymorphisms suggest that this type of variation is functional and may help predict disease susceptibility and develop new therapeutic strategies. Anti-TNF-alpha (TNF-α) drugs are highly effective RA treatments, but not all patients respond the same way. It's important to figure out whether RA risk alleles can identify and predict anti-TNF-α-responsiveness in RA patients.\n\n**Aims of the study:** \nExamine the function of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and caspase recruitment domain family member 8 (CARD8) genes polymorphisms and their morbid genotypes and alleles in RA patients and apparently healthy controls. In addition, their role in disease susceptibility, severity, and response to anti-TNF-α therapy. Also, examine how single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-1β.\n\n**Materials and methods:** \n100 RA patients (88 females, 12 males) and 100 apparently healthy people (86 females, 14 males) were examined. To measure serum TNF-α and IL-1β, Elabscience sandwich ELISA kits were used. Iraq Biotech, Turkey DNA extraction kit was used to extract genomic DNA from whole blood. CARD8 (rs2043211) and NLRP3 (rs4612666) were genotyped using Agilent, AriaMx, USA, through Tri-Plex SYBR Green-based real-time PCR allelic discrimination assays. Geneious software, version 2019.2.2, used to design primers from published sequences (GenBank accession no. GCA 009914755.1). Primer specificity was determined by NCBI's BLAST.\n\n**Results:** \nStudy found that there is association between cytokines serum level and 28-joints disease activity score (DAS-28). The level of TNF-α increases with the higher DAS-28 (r2 = 0.45, P < 0.0001). Also, IL- 1β level increases with higher DAS-28 (r2 = 0.51, P < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant variations between patients with RA and the control group in the distribution of CARD8 SNP rs2043211 and NLRP3 SNP rs4612666 genotypes (P = 0.17 and 0.08 respectively) as well their alleles (P = 0.059 and 0.879 respectively). CARD8 (rs2043211) TT genotype was more frequent in patients with higher DAS-28 (P < 0.0001) and higher TNF-α and IL-1β serum levels (P < 0.0001 for both). Also, NLRP3 (rs4612666) TT genotype was more frequent in patients with higher DAS-28 (P < 0.0001) and higher TNF-α and IL- 1β serum levels (P < 0.0001 for both). Interestingly, this study revealed that CARD8 (rs2043211) and NLRP3 (rs4612666) variant genotypes are associated with lower response to anti-TNF-α drugs.\n\n**Conclusions:** \nSerum TNF-α and IL-1β correlate with DAS-28 and disease activity. Non-responders have elevated TNF-α and IL-1β. CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 variant polymorphisms are associated with high serum TNF-α and IL-1β, active disease course, poor disease outcomes, and low response to anti-TNF-α therapy.\n\nKeywords: Rheumatoid arthritis, Etanercept, Infliximab, IL-1β, TNF-α, NLRP3, CARD8, Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)\n\n### Background\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a genetically predisposed, systemic, chronic, inflammatory disease.

Also, examine how single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-1β.\n\n### Materials and methods\n\n100 RA patients (88 females, 12 males) and 100 apparently healthy people (86 females, 14 males) were examined. To measure serum TNF-α and IL-1β, Elabscience sandwich ELISA kits were used. Iraq Biotech, Turkey DNA extraction kit was used to extract genomic DNA from whole blood. CARD8 (rs2043211) and NLRP3 (rs4612666) were genotyped using Agilent, AriaMx, USA, through Tri-Plex SYBR Green-based real-time PCR allelic discrimination assays. Geneious software, version 2019.2.2, used to design primers from published sequences (GenBank accession no. GCA 009914755.1). Primer specificity was determined by NCBI's BLAST.\n\n### Results\n\nStudy found that there is association between cytokines serum level and 28-joints disease activity score (DAS-28). The level of TNF-α increases with the higher DAS-28 (r^2^ = 0.45, P < 0.0001). Also, IL- 1β level increases with higher DAS-28 (r^2^ = 0.51, P < 0.0001). There were no statistically significant variations between patients with RA and the control group in the distribution of CARD8 SNP rs2043211 and NLRP3 SNP rs4612666 genotypes (P = 0.17 and 0.08 respectively) as well their alleles (P = 0.059 and 0.879 respectively). CARD8 (rs2043211) TT genotype was more frequent in patients with higher DAS-28 (P < 0.0001) and higher TNF-α and IL-1β serum levels (P < 0.0001 for both). Also, NLRP3 (rs4612666) TT genotype was more frequent in patients with higher DAS-28 (P < 0.0001) and higher TNF-α and IL- 1β serum levels (P < 0.0001 for both). Interestingly, this study revealed that CARD8 (rs2043211) and NLRP3 (rs4612666) variant genotypes are associated with lower response to anti-TNF-α drugs.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nSerum TNF-α and IL-1β correlate with DAS-28 and disease activity. Non-responders have elevated TNF-α and IL-1β. CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 variant polymorphisms are associated with high serum TNF-α and IL-1β, active disease course, poor disease outcomes, and low response to anti-TNF-α therapy.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation and joint damage [[1](#bib1)]. Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in RA pathogenesis, but the exact causes are unknown. RA pathogenesis also involves abnormal immune responses, both innate and adaptive. Many cytokines are involved in RA pathogenesis and persistence [[2](#bib2)]. As producers of cytokines and antigen presentation by phagocytes, innate immune system cells are crucial to disease initiation and maintenance [[3](#bib3)]. Monocytes/macrophages that release tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β contribute to joint inflammation. B-lymphocytes (B-cells) could control the immune response direction through antibody production by independent mechanism. Such processes include the presentation of antigen and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [[4](#bib4)].\n\nInnate and adaptive immune system activation are linked. Several studies have shown that NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome affects this relationship [[5](#bib5)]. NLRP3, a complex multimeric protein, controls inflammatory immune response, apoptosis, and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β as an upstream activator of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-lymphocytes (NF-κB) signaling [[6](#bib6)]. Inflammasome activation is tightly regulated by many processes, including transcription of NF-κB-dependent NLRP3 and IL-1β and endogenous proteins like caspase domain-containing protein 8 (CARD8), which physically interacts with caspase-1 and negatively regulates caspase-1-dependent IL-1β expression and NF-κB activation [[7](#bib7)].\n\nCARD8 and NLRP3 polymorphisms affect RA susceptibility and severity, according to several studies. Addobbati et al. (2018) found that CARD8 rs2043211 SNP (A > T) is associated with disease severity in RA clinical manifestations [[8](#bib8)]. Patients homozygous for the T allele had higher functional disability. The rs2043211 polymorphism introduces a premature stop codon (Cysteine > Stop) that produces a severely truncated protein [[9](#bib9)]. CARD8 role in inflammasome biology is unknown. CARD8 may modulate NLRP3 activation or induce NF-κB inflammasomes independently [[10](#bib10)]. CARD8 variation increases IL-1β secretion, especially when combined with NLRP3 rs35829419 [[11](#bib11)]. In addition, this variation associated with increased induction and translocation of NF-κB activity to the nucleus, resulting in high constitutive levels of RA inflammatory mediators like pro-IL-1β and TNF-α [[12](#bib12)]. Synovial cell proliferation and bone and cartilage degradation have also been linked to NF-κB [[13](#bib13)].\n\nRA treatment aims to promote remission or very low disease activity. Biological therapies improve clinical and radiographic outcomes for some RA patients. Hypoxia activates the NLRP3-inflammasome in active RA. Therefore, it is hypothesized that NLRP3-inflammasome is activated before biologics in RA patients and that anti-TNF-α therapy may modulate this activation [[14](#bib14)].\n\nNLRP3 gene polymorphism rs4612666T was associated with decreased expression. There was a relationship between two variants of NLRP3 (rs4925659 and rs10925026) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response. rs10925026 and rs4925648 in NLRP3 were associated with good versus no response. Rs10925026 C allele was associated with non-response, while rs4925659's A allele with improved response. rs4925659 variant had modest RA susceptibility with (rs10159239), but not rs10925026 or rs4925648 [[14](#bib14)]. Kastbom et al. (2010) found a link between CARD8 p. C10X polymorphism and RA severity in Swedish and Spanish patients. (c.30 TA, rs2043211) produces a premature stop codon (p.C10X). Compared to NLRP3/CARD8+/+, the combination of p. Q705K/p. C10X in NLRP3/CARD8 (−/−, denoting the two minor alleles) was significantly more frequent in RA patients [[15](#bib15)]. In early RA studies, the p. C10X CARD8 variant was linked to inflammatory activity and overrepresented in anti-TNF-α patients. RA has persistent innate immune system activation [[16](#bib16)].\n\nEuropean Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) response was nominally correlated with CARD8 SNP (rs11672725), with the T allele enhancing response [[8](#bib8)].\n\nDisease susceptibility and response to anti-TNF-α drugs suggest different genetic regulatory mechanisms in RA patients [[17](#bib17)]. Anti-TNF-α agents have greatly improved RA symptoms, but not all patients respond [[18](#bib18)]. Better diagnosis, treatment, and healthcare cost reduction are new concerns [[19](#bib19)]. The discovery of inherited variations (polymorphisms) and their relationship to immune system dysregulation, immune complex-mediated disease, and disease susceptibility suggests that this type of variation is functional and evolutionary and can help predict disease susceptibility and develop new therapeutic strategies [[20](#bib20)]. It is essential to determine whether these RA risk genotypes or alleles can pinpoint RA predisposition and predict patients’ response to biological drug before therapy. NLRP3 SNP rs4612666 and CARD8 SNP rs2043211 were examined in RA patients and healthy controls to determine their morbid genotypes and alleles. Additionally, examine the association of gene polymorphisms with disease susceptibility, severity, response to anti-TNF-α therapy, and serum TNF-α and IL-1β levels.\n\n## 2. Patients, materials and methods\n\nThe study recruited 100 patients with EULAR-defined RA and 100 apparently healthy subjects. All signed a biomedical research consent form. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) - College of Medicine/Al-Nahrain University. All patients were diagnosed and treated by rheumatologists at Baghdad Teaching Hospital - Rheumatology Unit from November 2018 to March 2020. RA patients with other chronic diseases and those treated with Etanercept or infliximab for less than 3 months were excluded from the study. As a control, apparently healthy subjects of similar age and sex were recruited. Venous blood was collected for genetic studies and measurement of serum level TNF-α and IL-1β. Age, gender, number of tender (TEN) and swollen (SW) joints were collected from RA patients. Visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain and disease activity were assessed by rheumatologist, Also, type of anti-TNF-α drug. DAS-28 assessed clinical disease activity, including remission, according to EULAR criteria. DAS-28 scores were used to divide patients into responders and non-responders subgroups ([Table 1](#tbl1)).\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| DAS-28 score | Disease activity/Response |\n| --- | --- |\n| DAS-28 < 2.60 | Remission |\n| DAS-28 ≥ 2.60 and ≤ 3.20 | Low or mild disease activity |\n| DAS-28 > 3.20 and ≤ 5.10 | Moderate disease activity |\n| DAS-28 > 5.10 | High or severe disease activity |\n| ΔDAS-28 ≥ 1.2 and DAS-28 ≤ 3.2 | Responders |\n| ΔDAS-28 ≤ 1.2 and DAS28 ≤ 5.1 | Non-responders |\n\nTable 1 Caption: EULAR-defined disease activity and treatment response after 3 months.\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from EDTA-anti-coagulated venous blood using Iraq Biotech Co., Turkey DNA extraction kit from whole blood according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were designed according to the published sequences (GenBank accession no. GCA_009914755.1) using Geneious software, version 2019.2.2. The software introduced a mismatch at the −2 position of the 3′ end of both allele-specific primers to increase reaction specificity ([Table 2](#tbl2)). The lyophilized primers were prepared according to Integrated DNA Technologies' (IDT, USA) instructions. BLAST program at national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) was used to determine the specificity of the primers ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast)).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Gene | SNP | Primers | Set Ta |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CARD8 | rs2043211-COM | TTTCTGAGACCCTTTGTGACAT | 54.7 |\n| rs2043211-A | CAGGAACAGCACGGAACA |  |  |\n| rs2043211-T | CAGGAACAGCACGGATCA |  |  |\n| NLRP3 | rs4612666-COM | ACAACAATGTGAAGTGCTTA | 51.2 |\n| rs4612666-A | GCTCCCACCAATACTACA |  |  |\n| rs4612666-G | GCTCCCACCAATACTACG |  |  |\n\nTable 2 Caption: The NLRP3 rs4612666 and CARD8 rs2043211 SNP primer sets.\n\nCARD8 (rs2043211) and NLRP3 (rs4612666) were genotyped using SYBR Green-based Tri-Plex real-time PCR allelic discrimination assay using AriaMx, Agilent, USA. In a total volume of 20 μL containing 10 μL of 2x SYBR Green PCR Master, 1 μL of each primer per reaction, 2 μL of the genomic DNA dilution, and distilled water to the final volume was mixed. The PCR thermal profile was as follows: an initial denaturation step (95 °C for 3 min, 1 cycle) was followed by amplification and quantification steps repeated for 40 cycles (95 °C for 5 s, primer set annealing temperature for 15sec (54.7 for CARD8 SNP and 51.2 for NLRP3 SNP), 72 °C for 20 s, with a single fluorescence measurement at the end of the elongation step at 72 °C). A high-resolution melting curves (HRMs) were constructed by lowering the temperature to 55 °C and later increasing the temperature by 0.2 °C each 30 s to 95 °C while continuously measuring the change in fluorescence. Melting temperature (Tm) values were automatically assigned a plot generated by the Agilent AriaMx software. Sandwich-ELISA Kits from Elabscience, USA, was used to measure TNF-α and IL-1β serum levels. The procedure was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. BioTek ELISA reader, USA, was used for all measurements. Statistical analysis operated using SPSS Statistics (V 25.0; IBM SPSS Software, USA). A P < 0.05 (exact two-sided) was accepted as level of significance. Continuous variables were subjected to a normality test. If the data had a normal distribution, the *t*-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare means. Therefore, these variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Binomial variables were expressed as numbers and percentages and analyzed with Chi-square test. Binary logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in order to assess the association between polymorphisms different genotypes and alleles in RA patients.\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Demographic and clinical features of the patients and controls\n\nThe proportion of females to males in both the patient and control groups were comparable statistically (P = 0.67). RA is 7.33 times more common in women than men, females made up 88% of RA patients.\n\nThe mean age of female patients was 49.84 (±11.69) and the mean age of female controls was 53.09 (±10.52), P = 0.056. The mean age of males in patients and controls was 39.33 (±9.59) and 44.86 (±10.26), respectively, P = 0.171 ([Table 3](#tbl3)).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n| Parameters |  | Patient (n = 100) | Control (n = 100) | Total (n = 200) | P value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SexCount (Percent) | Female | 88 (88%) | 86 (86%) | 174 (174%) | 0.674 |\n| Male | 12 (12%) | 14 (14%) | 26 (26%) |  |  |\n| Age (Years)Mean (±SD) | Female | 49.84 (11.69) | 53.09 (10.52) | 51.45 (11.22) | 0.056 |\n| Male | 39.33 (9.59) | 44.86 (10.26) | 42.31 (10.15) | 0.171 |  |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Sex and age of patients and control participants.\n\nThirty-four of 100 RA patients (14 etanercept and 20 infliximab) did not respond to anti-TNF-α therapy, while 66 (38 and 28) did. [Table 4](#tbl4) shows that the difference in treatment response between the two drugs was not statistically significant (P = 0.120). Moreover, after 3 months of treatment, the DAS-28 was 3.89 (±0.98) compared to 4.92 (±1.29) at baseline. Etanercept and infliximab had similar DAS-28 scores after 3 months (P = 0.88). 63% of RA patients had moderate disease activity, 19% low, and 10% high. Only 8% of patients had remission after 3 months of treatment. As shown in [Table 4](#tbl4), the effects of the two drugs were comparable (P = 0.32). Most RA males responded better to anti-TNF-α than females (P = 0.045) and showed lower DAS-28 after 3 months, with mean of 2.77 versus 4.04 respectively (P = 0.0001), despite baseline mean was not significantly different between sexes (P = 0.902). The disease activity was significantly different between males and females (P < 0.0001), and males were more likely to respond to anti-TNF-α treatment after 3 months, showing remission or low disease activity than females. High disease activity was found in 0/12 male patients.\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| Parameters |  | Type of Drug |  |  | P value | Sex |  |  | P value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Etanercept (n = 52) | Infliximab (n = 48) | Total | Female (n = 88) | Male (n = 12) | Total |  |  |  |  |\n| ResponseCount (Percent) | Non-responders | 14 (14%) | 20 (20%) | 34 (34%) | 0.120 | 33 (33%) | 1 (1%) | 34 (34%) | 0.045 |\n| Responders | 38 (38%) | 28 (28%) | 66 (66%) | 55 (55%) | 11 (11%) | 66 (66%) |  |  |  |\n| DAS-28 scoreMean (±SD) | Baseline | 5.30 (1.08) | 4.51 (1.39) | 4.92 (1.29) | 0.002 | 4.92 (1.27) | 4.97 (1.52) | 4.95 (1.29) | 0.902 |\n| After 3 months | 3.90 (0.91) | 3.87 (1.07) | 3.89 (0.98) | 0.881 | 4.04 (0.91) | 2.77 (0.76) | 3.89 (0.98) | <0.0001 |  |\n| Disease activity after 3 monthsCount (Percent) | Remission | 2 (2%) | 6 (6%) | 8 (8%) | 0.321 | 4 (4%) | 4 (4%) | 8 (8%) | <0.0001 |\n| Low | 11 (11%) | 8 (8%) | 19 (19%) | 13 (13%) | 6 (6%) | 19 (19%) |  |  |  |\n| Moderate | 35 (35%) | 28 (28%) | 63 (63%) | 61 (61%) | 2 (2%) | 63 (63%) |  |  |  |\n| High | 4 (4%) | 6 (6%) | 10 (10%) | 10 (10%) | 0 (0%) | 10 (10%) |  |  |  |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Clinical characteristics of RA patients.\n\nRA patients had higher TNF-α levels than controls, with a mean concentration of 7.84 pg/mL versus 6.09 pg/mL, P = 0.0005. IL-1β levels were also significantly higher in patients than controls, with a mean concentration of 2.18 pg/mL versus 1.21 pg/mL respectively (P < 0.0001). In RA patients taking infliximab or etanercept, serum TNF-α and IL-1β levels were measured. Etanercept and infliximab-treated RA patients had similar IL-1β levels (P = 0.168). TNF-α was higher in infliximab-treated patients, but not significant (P = 0.088). DAS-28 correlated positively with TNF-α (r^2^ = 0.45, P < 0.0001) and IL- 1β (r^2^ = 0.51, P < 0.0001). TNF-α and IL-1β concentrations were significantly higher in patients with moderate to high disease activity and lower in those in remission or low disease activity (P = 0.001 and < 0.0001). Most responders had lower IL-1β and TNF-α (P < 0.0001). Low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were linked to biologic anti-TNFα agent responsiveness by blood cytokine profiling ([Table 5](#tbl5)).\n\n### Table 5.\n\n| Parameters |  | TNF-α |  | IL- 1β |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mean (SD) | P value | Mean (SD) | P value |  |  |\n| GroupMean (±SD) | Patients | 7.84 (5.57) | 0.005 | 2.18 (1.21) | <0.0001 |\n| Control | 6.09 (2.79) | 1.20 (0.58) |  |  |  |\n| Type of drugMean (±SD) | Etanercept | 6.93 (4.67) | 0.088 | 1.97 (1.16) | 0.102 |\n| Infliximab | 8.83 (6.30) | 2.39 (1.38) |  |  |  |\n| Disease activity after 3 monthsMean (±SD) | Remission | 4.52 (1.83) | 0.001 | 1.28 (0.48) | <0.0001 |\n| Low | 5.34 (2.26) | 1.53 (0.61) |  |  |  |\n| Moderate | 8.15 (6.1) | 2.25 (1.3) |  |  |  |\n| High | 13.31 (3.79) | 3.68 (1.22) |  |  |  |\n| ResponseMean (±SD) | Non-responder | 13.68 (5.50) | <0.0001 | 3.36 (1.24) | <0.0001 |\n| Responder | 4.83 (2.18) | 1.57 (0.58) |  |  |  |\n| DAS-28 score | (Pearson correlation) | 0.45 | <0.0001 | 0.51 | <0.0001 |\n\nTable 5 Caption: Serum TNF-α and IL- 1β in the patients and control groups.\n\n### 3.2.

Comparing SNPs models reveal that lower TNF-α and IL- 1β serum level after 3 months of treatment were associated with dominant models of CARD8 (rs2043211) SNPs (P < 0.0001 for both), while higher cytokines level associated with recessive model (P < 0.0001 for both). Recessive model of NLRP3 (rs4612666) was associated with higher TNF-α and IL- 1β serum level after 3 months of treatment (P = 0.002 and P < 0.0001 respectively), where T allele bearing genotypes (Variant homozygous and heterozygous) were significantly associated with higher cytokines level. In contrast, dominant model was not significantly correlated with TNF-α and IL- 1β serum level (P = 0.764 and 0.187 respectively), [Table 8](#tbl8).\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nTumor necrosis factor-α antagonists have been the most effective tool for controlling patients suffering from a variety of rheumatic diseases over the last two decades. Infliximab and etanercept can induce remission, decrease the disease activity and prevent the progression of both clinical and radiological disease in RA, with a significant improvement in the symptoms, function and quality of life of patients [[21](#bib21)]. Approximately one-third of patients display a lack of response to anti-TNF-α therapies, either due to lack of drug efficacy or following the occurrence of adverse events (AEs). There are variations in their site of action and molecular structure, although the 2 drugs exert their beneficial effects by blockade of TNF-α. These differences may explain the differential response to the 2 agents in individual patients, even though there is no direct evidence to support this [[22](#bib22)]. A total of 10 studies involving 1806 subjects were included in meta-analysis review, which suggested that anti-TNF-α inhibitor antibodies had a significant association with decreased anti-TNF-α response. Anti-TNF-α agents for RA treatment are unsuccessful in some patients [[23](#bib23)]. One causative factor for non-response to anti-TNF-α drugs, such as infliximab and etanercept for RA treatment, is anti-TNF-α inhibitor antibodies produced in patients [[24](#bib24)]. Several studies suggest that the main reasons for different clinical responses could be different bioavailability and diverse expression of anti-TNF-α inhibitor antibodies in RA patients [[25](#bib25),[26](#bib26)]. The key cause of treatment failure is known to be immunogenicity of the anti-TNF-α agents [[27](#bib27)]. Due to the variety of factors such as route of administration, drug dosage, concomitant medication, comprehensive treatment plan, and immune and nutritional status, the immunogenicity rate of different anti-TNF-α drugs is different [[28](#bib28)]. Extensive studies have investigated the impact on drug efficacy and safety of the immunogenicity of anti-TNF-α agents and have found that antibodies to these agents, such as infliximab, can affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug, resulting in delayed infusion and injection site reactions [[28](#bib28),[29](#bib29)]. Meanwhile, infliximab-induced anti-chimeric antibodies (ATIs) could enhance the clearance of infliximab and attenuate its function [[30](#bib30)]. This may be a plausible explanation for the essential association of anti-TNF-α inhibitor antibodies with a reduced response rate.\n\nCurrent study compared the levels of cytokines in infliximab and etanercept groups in patients with RA who received either treatment. The findings showed that IL-1β and TNF-α levels appeared to be identical in both groups, as both drugs seem to have relatively similar anti-inflammatory properties. These two drugs are both monoclonal antibodies and share a relatively similar mechanism to inhibit production of TNF-α by neutralizing the biological activity of TNF-α by binding to the soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-α with a high affinity and by inhibiting or preventing the successful binding of TNF-α with its receptors [[31](#bib31)]. The only difference is their nature; infliximab is a monoclonal chimeric anti-TNF-α antibody that binds both monomeric and trimeric soluble TNF and transmembrane TNF, with murine variable regions and human IgG1 constant regions. Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein connected to the Fc domains of human IgG1 consisting of the extracellular portion of TNFRp75. Etanercept binds only trimeric TNF and, compared to infliximab, interacts with transmembrane TNF with reduced avidity [[32](#bib32)].\n\nAnalysis has identified variations in cytokine levels between RA patients and control group. Mean serum TNF-α levels were significantly higher in RA patients after 3 months of treatment, and IL-1β levels were also significantly higher in the patients group.\n\nThere was a significant relation between serum level of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) and disease activity and response to anti-TNF-α agents after 3 months of treatment, where it was directly proportional with it. Cytokines with different levels of expression have also been found in those patients who responded to anti-TNF-α therapy relative to patients who did not. Cytokines can be useful biomarkers of the tendency of a patient to respond to a particular biological therapy.\n\nThe pivotal role played by TNF-α and IL-1β in the development and maintenance of inflammation in non-responder RA patients is supported by decreased cytokines in responding patients receiving anti-TNF-α drugs. Another interesting finding is that patients who did not respond (3 months post-therapy) to anti-TNF-α therapy had significantly higher serum IL-1β concentrations. This finding confirms recently published data that showed elevated expression of the IL-1β gene in synovial biopsies from adalimumab therapy non-responders [[33](#bib33)]. In inflammatory diseases, IL-1β is an emerging target for drug therapy, and anakinra (Recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist) has been developed to block IL-1β signaling as a biological therapy [[34](#bib34)]. However, indirect associations with adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab have shown a trend towards greater anti-TNF-α drug efficacy [[21](#bib21)].\n\nAfter an insult, TNF-α (and other cytokines) are developed by the cells of the innate immune system, raising and prolonging the inflammatory response by triggering the release of several cytokines by other cells (i.e., IL-1β). Via decreased FOXP3 expression, TNF-α has been shown to suppress Treg function, an effect that can be reversed by TNF-α blockade [[35](#bib35)]. Therefore, the elevation of IL-1β and TNF-α in a non-responder serum can be a biomarker of the response to anti-TNF-α therapy. Prospective research will explain if it could be possible to use the ratio of these cytokines to predict response to anti-TNF-α medication. Such a study should obviously be structured to account for possible influencing factors in the diagnosis, such as prior and concurrent drug treatment, duration of the disease.\n\nThe goal of the study was to explore the impact of genetic factors on the susceptibility of RA. Selected SNP in the study CARD8 rs2043211 (A > T) and NLRP3 rs4612666 (T > C) have identified the significance of their role in RA pathogenesis in several previous studies. Our results indicate that the 2 SNPs were not associated with RA susceptibility.\n\nThe influence of CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 polymorphisms was stated after 3 months of RA treatment. T allele bearing genotypes (Variant homozygous genotypes and heterozygous genotypes) for CARD8 rs2043211 NLRP3 rs4612666 polymorphism had significantly higher DAS-28. Consequently, variant genotypes of CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 were related with higher disease activity and lower response to TNF-inhibitors, also higher concentration of TNF-α and IL-1β.\n\nThis may be due to the NLRP3 gain-of-function polymorphism, leading to an overactive NLRP3 inflammasome [[35](#bib35),[36](#bib36)], and possibly to increased activation of IL-1β [[37](#bib37)]. DAS-28 was highly affected by homozygosity for the polymorphic CARD8 rs2043211 T allele. The findings were consistent with the study documenting the effect of CARD8 rs2043211 on the more serious course of long-lasting RA disease [[38](#bib38)].\n\nTruncated CARD8 resulting from CARD8 rs2043211 could decrease its influence over the signaling pathway of NF-κB and thus lead to a more active transcriptional factor and inflammatory process amplification [[38](#bib38)]. For the expression of both inflammatory cytokines and tissue destructive enzymes in RA, NF-κB is essential [[39](#bib39),[40](#bib40)].\n\nIn the gene expression analysis, the contribution of NLRP3 and CARD8 to active RA was shown, in particular in patients with RA, NLRP3 was upregulated and CARD8 was downregulated in contrast to healthy controls. In a well-powered study of UK RA patients, the results verified the association between the NLRP3 gene and the EULAR anti-TNF-α response [[14](#bib14)]. Therefore, good and moderate EULAR response versus no response in two separate cohorts have been correlated with polymorphisms in the NLRP3 gene region in RA patients treated with anti-TNF-α. This is a good predictor of a true relationship between the gene and the response to treatment. The data also showed that polymorphisms of CARD8 rs2043211 were significantly associated with EULAR response to anti-TNF-α therapy. The significance of NLRP3-inflammasome in RA pathogenesis is demonstrated by the findings of increased mRNA NLRP3 in RA synovial tissue relative to osteoarthritis subjects [[39](#bib39)]. In a cell expression analysis, Hitomi et al., 2009, found that rs4612666 variant allele to induce lower mRNA expression by reducing the transcriptional enhancer activity (in intron 7) of the NLRP3 gene [[41](#bib41)]. However, because the association found in this polymorphism remained statistically important this SNP is functionally relevant for the outcome of anti-TNF-α treatment in RA patients [[42](#bib42)].\n\nThe caspase-associated recruitment domain (CARD) is a conserved homology domain and a protein-protein interaction module [[43](#bib43)], it is a member of the CARD protein family, has been proposed to be part of the inflammasome family proteins [[44](#bib44)]. The inflammasome is a complex of cytoplasmic proteins that play a crucial role in the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines [[45](#bib45)], such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 [[46](#bib46),[47](#bib47)]. These cytokines are known to cause a range of infection-related biological effects, inflammation, and autoimmune processes and they are highly implicated in the pathogenesis of RA by activating the adaptive immune response [[46](#bib46),[47](#bib47)] CARD8 has been shown to be a negative regulator of activation of NF-κB and caspase-1, suggest its role in suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation, this led to the immune response and inflammatory activity to be suppressed [[44](#bib44)]. CARD8 is a new signaling molecule involved in the regulation of activation of caspase-1 and NF-κB [[48](#bib48)] and plays a key role in the development of RA [[47](#bib47)].\n\nGenetic variants of CARD8 are also important in the pathogenesis of a variety of inflammatory diseases [[49](#bib49)]. The gene polymorphisms of CARD8 have been associated with several inflammatory and immune diseases, such as RA [[15](#bib15),[43](#bib43)], Crohn's disease [[50](#bib50)], gout [[51](#bib51)], ankylosing spondylitis [[52](#bib52)], and atopic dermatitis [[53](#bib53)]. A polymorphism of CARD8 and rs2043211, is associated with the risk of RA [[43](#bib43)].\n\nThis study has some limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small because some patients discontinued treatment before 3 months, limiting the study power. Second, because autoimmune diseases are more common in women, we failed to recruit more men. RA patients almost over 40 years old and rarely have no medical issues or chronic diseases. Second, we investigated only two NLRP3 inflammasome polymorphisms, more SNPs should be assessed. Finally, because RA is genetically heterogeneous among ethnicities, our findings only apply to Iraqis.\n\n## 5. Conclusions\n\nThe goal of this case-control study was to find out more about the association between RA and polymorphisms in the inflammasome-related genes (CARD8 and NLRP3) in Iraqi people. Neither etanercept nor infliximab is better than the other for treating RA. The study found an increase in the frequency of RA in older females, indicating that pathogenesis includes genetic and physiological differences. Both males and females had a positive response to anti-TNF-α therapy, but females had a poorer clinical response. No significant difference was found between the risk of RA and CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 polymorphisms. However, we found that variant genotypes of CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 were associated to a more active course of disease after 3 months of treatment, bad outcomes of disease activity, low response to anti-TNF-α therapy, and high levels of serum TNF-α and IL-1β.\n\n## Author contribution statement\n\nAhmed Abdul-Hassan Abbas and Ahmed Sahib Abdulamir: Conceived and designed the experiments.\n\nAbdullah Abbas Awni: Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.\n\nZainab Oday Hamed: Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nData included in article/supplementary material/referenced in article.\n\n## Declaration of competing interest\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\n## Contributor Information\n\nAbdullah Abbas Awni, Email: abdullah.awni@uom.edu.iq.\n\nZainab Oday Hamed, Email: zainab_uday@bcms.edu.iq.\n\nAhmed Abdul-Hassan Abbas, Email: ahmedabdulhassan@colmed-alnahrain.edu.iq.\n\nAhmed Sahib Abdulamir, Email: ahmed.sahib@colmed-alnahrain.edu.iq.\n\n## Associated Data\n\n*This section collects any data citations, data availability statements, or supplementary materials included in this article.*\n\n### Data Availability Statement\n\nData included in article/supplementary material/referenced in article.\n\n### Data Availability Statement\n\nData included in article/supplementary material/referenced in article.\n\n## References\n\n1.

There were no significant differences in the incidence of major bleeding or all-cause mortality between carriers and noncarriers.\n\n### Meaning\n\nThese findings suggest that clopidogrel may be less effective in preventing cardiovascular events in patients who are carriers of loss-of-function *CYP2C19* alleles.\n\n### Importance\n\nCytochrome P450 2C19 (*CYP2C19*) genotypes influence the antiplatelet effectiveness of clopidogrel by affecting its conversion to its active metabolite. However, evidence from prospective trials regarding the effects of *CYP2C19* genotypes on the role of clopidogrel preventing cardiovascular events among patients with acute ischemic stroke remains limited.\n\n### Objective\n\nTo investigate the association of the *CYP2C19* genotypes with the clinical prognosis of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel.\n\n### Design, Setting, and Participants\n\nA prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted from September 1, 2019, to January 27, 2023, at 37 clinical sites in South Korea. Patients who received clopidogrel within 72 hours of experiencing an acute ischemic stroke were included.\n\n### Interventions\n\nPatients were classified using *CYP2C19* genotyping into carrier and noncarrier of *CYP2C19* loss-of-function (LOF) allele. Clopidogrel treatment was maintained throughout the study period.\n\n### Main Outcomes and Measures\n\nThe primary outcome was the difference in the risk of cardiovascular events (including ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death) within 6 months after an ischemic stroke between patients who were carriers or noncarriers of the *CYP2C19* LOF allele. The primary safety outcomes were the differences in all-cause mortality and the occurrence of major bleeding. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.\n\n### Results\n\nOverall, 2925 patients were enrolled in the PLATELET trial. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 65.3 (12.4) years, and 1928 (66.3%) were men. Among these patients, 15 were excluded. Of the remaining 2910 patients, 61.3% were classified as poor or intermediate metabolizers and 38.7% as extensive metabolizers. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in carriers of the LOF *CYP2C19* allele than in noncarriers (2.7% [49 of 1785] vs 1.6% [18 of 1125]; log-rank *P* = .048). No significant differences were observed between *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers and noncarriers regarding the occurrence of major bleeding (0.6% [11 of 1785] vs 0.8% [9 of 1125]; *P* = .56) and all-cause mortality (0.3% [5] vs 0.1% [1]; *P* = .27).\n\n### Conclusions and Relevance\n\nIn this prospective nonrandomized clinical trial, carriers of the *CYP2C19* LOF allele genotype exhibited a higher likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular events.\n\n### Trial Registration\n\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: [NCT04072705](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04072705)\n\n## Introduction\n\nClopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug used for secondary prevention in patients with a history of stroke, coronary artery disease, or peripheral artery disease.^1^ Clopidogrel is a thienopyridine prodrug that is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) in the liver to an active metabolite with antiplatelet activity. Consequently, the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel might be insufficient when its metabolism is disrupted, such as when medications that are competitively metabolized by the same CYP are administered concomitantly or because of CYP genotypes associated with poor metabolism.^2^ Studies have reported that *CYP2C19* genotype, the metabolic enzyme of clopidogrel, affects the effectiveness of clopidogrel and the risk of cardiovascular disease.^3,4,5,6,7^ In patients with acute or transient ischemic attack, the use of aspirin with clopidogrel reduces the risk of recurrent stroke compared with aspirin monotherapy in noncarriers of the *CYP2C19* loss of function (LOF) allele.^3,8^ However, evidence from prospective trials on the effect of the *CYP2C19* genotype on the cardiovascular event preventive role of clopidogrel in patients with acute ischemic stroke is still limited. This PLATELET trial aimed to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular events differs in patients receiving clopidogrel for acute ischemic stroke according to their *CYP2C19* genotypes.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Design\n\nThe PLATELET trial was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label trial conducted at 37 sites in South Korea. Patients were enrolled from September 1, 2019, through January 27, 2023. The details of the rationale and design of the PLATELET trial have been published and are revealed in the trial protocol ([Supplement 1](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)), trial protocol amendment ([Supplement 2](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)), Statistical Analysis Plan ([Supplement 3](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)), and the eMethods in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s).^9^ All study patients received clopidogrel and the presence of the *CYP2C19* LOF allele was assessed. An independent data and safety monitoring board had access to all data and monitored the trial. The outcome event was confirmed by the committee members who were blinded to the *CYP2C19* genotype result. Trial monitoring was performed by an external service provider (Synex; South Korea). Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or their representatives before screening; participants did not receive financial compensation. The institutional review boards of all participating hospitals approved this study. This study followed the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations With Nonrandomized Designs ([TREND](https://www.cdc.gov/hivpartners/php/trend-statement/index.html)) reporting guideline.\n\n### Patient Population and Clinical Variables\n\nPatients who experienced an acute ischemic stroke and received clopidogrel, 75-300 mg, within 72 hours of stroke onset and underwent *CYP2C19* genotyping were enrolled. The timing of the index stroke was determined based on the first appearance of associated neurologic abnormalities. Because this was a nonrandomized trial, there were no restrictions regarding clopidogrel administration. Combination therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel was permitted at the physician’s discretion. However, the administration of other antiplatelets or anticoagulants was restricted and clopidogrel therapy was maintained until the end of the study. The participants were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment to monitor the occurrence of cardiovascular events and adverse reactions.\n\n### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\nPatients who met the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: (1) had acute ischemic stroke confirmed using brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance image, (2) received clopidogrel within 72 hours after stroke onset, (3) were older than 19 years, (4) agreed to participate in the study within 7 days after stroke onset, and (5) completed *CYP2C19* genotyping. We excluded patients who met the following criteria: (1) received oral anticoagulants at the time of screening or were scheduled to take the medication within 6 months; (2) required antiplatelet agents other than aspirin and clopidogrel; (3) had received clopidogrel within 1 week before the index ischemic stroke; (4) were scheduled for coronary angioplasty, coronary stent insertion, coronary artery bypass grafting, carotid endarterectomy, or cerebral artery stent implantation within 6 months; (5) received diagnoses of severe comorbidities with an expected life span of less than 2 years or a malignant tumor that had not been cured; (6) had participated in another drug trial within the previous 30 days; (7) had findings corresponding to high-risk factors among the causes of cardiac embolism according to Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification^1^; and (8) had expected difficulty participating and continuing in this study according to the researcher’s judgment.\n\n### Measure and Classification of CYP2C19 Genotypes\n\nBased on the result of *CYP2C19* genotyping (**1*, **2*, **3*, and **17* alleles), we defined extensive metabolizers as patients with **1/*1*, **1/*17*, and **17/*17* genotypes; intermediate metabolizers as patients with only one **2* or **3* genotypes (**1/*2*, **1/*3*, **2/*17*, and **3/*17*); and poor metabolizers as patients with only **2* or **3* genotypes (**2/*2*, **2/*3*, and **3/*3*). In line with the study protocol, we dichotomized patients into the LOF allele carrier (intermediate or poor metabolizer group) and LOF allele noncarrier (extensive metabolizer group).^3,10,11^\n\n### Outcomes\n\nThe primary outcome measure was the difference in cardiovascular events (stroke, including ischemic or hemorrhagic, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death) within 6 months after an ischemic stroke between patients categorized as carrier or noncarrier of the *CYP2C19* LOF allele. Patients were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment. The secondary outcome was the difference in the development of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack without brain imaging lesions, myocardial infarction, coronary artery revascularization procedures within 6 months, and deterioration of neurologic symptoms within 7 days or good functional outcome at 3 months after the initial stroke (modified Rankin scale 0-2) between carrier and noncarrier of the LOF allele. The safety outcome assessed the difference in all-cause mortality and the occurrence of major bleeding events, including fatal bleeding, symptomatic cerebral hemorrhage, ocular bleeding, bleeding requiring transfusion of 2 or more pints of blood, or bleeding requiring hospitalization within 6 months.\n\n### Covariates\n\nWe evaluated the differences in the risks for the primary outcomes according to the *CYP2C19* genotypes (eTable 1 in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)). Preplanned subgroup analyses were performed based on sex, hypertension, diabetes, initial stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score), and TOAST classification. Detailed information on the covariates is available in the published study protocol.^9^ The detailed method for estimating the sample size is described in the eMethods in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s).\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nBaseline characteristics are presented according to the *CYP2C19* genotype groups (carrier and noncarrier of the LOF allele). Categorical variables are presented as numbers (percentage), and continuous variables as median (IQR) or mean (SD), as appropriate. *P* values were determined using the χ^2^ test, Fisher exact test, independent *t* test, and Mann-Whitney test. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle for the outcomes. To assess the risk of developing a primary outcome within 6 months, participants were followed up until the occurrence of cardiovascular events or were censored at their last follow-up assessment or at the time of withdrawal from the study, whichever occurred first. The cumulative risks of the primary outcome, ischemic or hemorrhagic event, and bleeding events during the 180-day follow-up period are reported as Kaplan-Meier estimates with log-rank test and cumulative incidence plot. The multivariable model was used to analyze the influence of *CYP2C19* genotype groups on the primary outcome, adjusting for covariates including age, sex, obesity, vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking history), TOAST classification, history of cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke), estimated glomerular filtration rate, aspirin therapy during admission, platelet reactivity unit, and NIHSS score. Due to overfitting in multivariable analysis, TOAST classification was entered separately as small-vessel occlusion or large-artery atherosclerosis. The NIHSS score was adjusted with ordinal variables because of nonnormal distribution. For sensitivity analysis, 1:1 propensity-weighted matching analysis for carriers and noncarriers of the LOF allele was performed (eMethods in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)). Cox proportional hazards regression methods were used for calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). All hypothesis tests were 2-sided with a significance threshold set at 5%.\n\n## Results\n\n### Participants and Follow-Up\n\nFrom September 1, 2019, through January 27, 2023, a total of 2925 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [12.4] years; 1928 men [66.3%]; 982 women [33.7%]) were enrolled from 37 clinical sites in the PLATELET trial. Fifteen patients were excluded from the study due to protocol violation. The final analysis comprised 2910 patients, with 1785 (61.3%) identified as carriers of the LOF allele and 1125 (38.7% [1125]) as noncarriers of the LOF allele (eFigure in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)). No significant differences were observed in the baseline demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and medical history between the 2 groups except for the history of cerebral infarction ([Table 1](#zoi250037t1)). The proportion of patients with a history of cerebral infarction was higher in the LOF allele carriers (8.9% [158 of 1785]) than in the noncarriers (6.6% [74 of 1125]) (*P* = .03). According to the TOAST classification, 30.0% of the patients (872 of 2910) had large-artery atherosclerosis and 41.0% had lacunar infarction (1192 of 2910). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in stroke classification, laboratory results, initial NIHSS score, and aspirin use during hospitalization. The proportion of patients with the intermediate metabolizer phenotype was 47.8% (n = 1391) and the proportion of poor metabolizers was 13.5% (n = 394).\n\n### Table 1.

[Figure 1](#zoi250037f1) shows the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events among patients with different *CYP2C19* genotypes. The primary outcome of composite cardiovascular events occurred significantly more in the LOF allele carrier group (49 of 1785 [2.7%]) compared with the noncarrier group (18 of 1125 [1.6%]) (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34-1.00; *P* = .048 for log-rank test). [Table 2](#zoi250037t2) reports the incidence rate for effectiveness and safety outcomes. There was no significant difference between the LOF allele carrier and noncarrier groups regarding the occurrence of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related death. However, stroke recurrence was more frequent in the LOF allele carrier group (45 [2.5%]) than in the LOF allele noncarrier group (16 [1.4%]) (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32-1.00; *P* = .047).\n\n### Figure 1.

Other outcomes were not significantly different between the groups ([Table 2](#zoi250037t2)).\n\n### Safety Outcomes\n\nThere was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the occurrence of a major bleeding event (11 of 1785 [0.6%] in LOF allele carriers and 9 of 1125 [0.8%] in LOF allele noncarriers; HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.53-3.13; *P* = .56), noncardiogenic death (3 [0.2%]) in LOF allele carriers and 1 [0.1%] in LOF allele noncarriers; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.56-5.08; *P* = .58). In addition, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality (5 [0.3%] in LOF allele carriers and 1 [0.1%] in LOF allele noncarriers; HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.04-2.71; *P* = .27 for log-rank test) ([Figure 2](#zoi250037f2)).\n\n### Figure 2. Cumulative Incidence Plot for the Safety Outcomes.\n\n![Figure 2. ](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ed01/11971672/80158ca648b0/jamanetwopen-e250398-g002.jpg)\n\n### Secondary Analysis\n\nTo explore the potential interaction between *CYP2C19* genotypes and covariates for the primary outcome, we performed a subgroup analysis (eTable 2 in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)). Among smokers, LOF allele noncarriers had significantly less occurrence of the primary outcome compared with LOF allele carriers (HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.64; *P* = .02; *P* = .03 for interaction). In other subgroups, such as age and obesity, no significant differences were observed between LOF allele carriers and noncarriers. There was no possible site effect according to included locations (eTable 3 in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)). In sensitivity analysis, even after propensity-weighted score matching, main results were still consistent with those of before propensity-weighted score matching (eTable 4 and eTable 5 in [Supplement 4](#note-ZOI250037-1-s)).\n\nWhen comparing the intermediate metabolizer group with the poor metabolizer group as the reference, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of the primary outcome (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.49-1.88; *P* = .92). Additionally, no significant difference was observed in patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel combination therapy (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.50-1.93; *P* = .98) between the intermediate and poor metabolizer groups. The primary outcome did not occur in patients who received clopidogrel monotherapy; therefore, statistical analysis could not be performed between the intermediate and poor metabolizer groups in patients who received clopidogrel monotherapy.\n\n### Result of Cox Regression Analysis\n\nTo address the potential influence of age, sex, and risk factors on the primary outcomes, a multivariate Cox regression model was constructed. This model included *CYP2C19* genotype, age, sex, TOAST classification, eGFR, and risk factors ([Table 3](#zoi250037t3)).

The risk of cardiovascular events within 6 months was significantly lower in LOF allele noncarriers (1.6%) than in LOF allele carriers (2.7%) (log-rank *P* = .048). Stroke recurrence was more common among LOF allele carriers (2.5%) than noncarriers (1.4%). There was no significant difference between the 2 genotypes regarding the incidence of major bleeding. Our study suggests that the *CYP2C19* genotype of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel exhibits different probabilities of composite cardiovascular events, particularly recurrent stroke after ischemic stroke.\n\nOur study encompassed all patients with stroke, regardless of stroke severity, and excluded patients with transient ischemic attack, unlike the Association Between *CYP2C19* Loss-of-Function Allele Status and Efficacy of Clopidogrel for Risk Reduction Among Patients With Minor Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (CHANCE) and Clopidogrel and Aspirin in Acute Ischemic Stroke and High-Risk TIA (POINT) trials,^3,8^ which included only patients with minor stroke events and transient ischemic attack. Treatment in all patients in our study was maintained with clopidogrel. This approach is more reflective of what happens in clinical practice settings among patients with ischemic stroke receiving clopidogrel. The primary outcome of this prospective trial was the risk of cardiovascular events, and we documented the differences in risk according to the *CYP2C19* genotype in 2910 Korean patients treated with clopidogrel. This study provides evidence that the *CYP2C19* genotype is directly associated with the estimated clinical outcome of patients receiving treatment with clopidogrel for acute cerebral infarction. These findings are consistent with a previous systematic review on this topic, which included 15 studies, 12 of which were conducted in Asian populations.^12^\n\nLoss of function allele carriers of the *CYP2C19* genotype account for approximately 30% of the White population and approximately 60% of the Asian population.^12,13,14^ Given this high prevalence of *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers among Asian populations, it is crucial to determine the influence of the metabolizer phenotype on antiplatelet therapy allocations and clinical outcomes. Consistent with prior data from randomized clinical trials and observational studies, our study findings provide additional evidence supporting genetic testing that may allow clinicians to personalize antiplatelet therapy, especially for Asian populations, where the prevalence of *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers is high.^3,4,13,15,16^ The CHANCE-2 randomized clinical trial has documented that treatment with ticagrelor, another potent antiplatelet not affected by the *CYP2C19* genotype, was superior in the secondary prevention of stroke among *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers.^16^ Regarding the high prevalence of *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers and their worse prognosis with clopidogrel treatment shown in this study, we suggest that genetic testing and personalized antiplatelet therapy would be reasonable for the prevention of secondary cardiovascular events among Asian patients with acute ischemic stroke. Moreover, antiplatelet agents with less metabolic variability, such as ticagrelor, could serve as effective alternatives for patients with stroke with *CYP2C19* LOF alleles.\n\nIn our study, the risk of major bleeding among LOF allele carriers (0.6%) was not significantly greater than that among noncarriers (0.8%) (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.53-3.13; *P* = .56). This finding aligns with the CHANCE trial results, which reported 2.3% for carriers and 2.5% for noncarriers in the clopidogrel plus aspirin group and 1.4% for carriers and 1.7% for noncarriers in the aspirin-only group.^3^ In a meta-analysis of 7 studies, bleeding occurred in 2.4% of *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers and 3.1% of noncarriers, without a significant difference.^12^ These findings suggest that *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers are at an increased risk of developing new stroke and composite vascular events than noncarriers, while the risk of bleeding remains similar between the 2 groups.\n\nReduced clopidogrel effectiveness in preventing recurrent ischemic stroke has been reported in *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers in Western countries.^17,18^ However, the effect of the *CYP2C19* genotype on the use of clopidogrel in preventing ischemic stroke remains controversial.^19,20^ Contrary to studies in Western countries, studies in Asian countries, especially in the Han Chinese population, have reported significant differences in recurrent cerebral infarction between LOF allele carriers and noncarriers.^3,4^ This may be due to the higher prevalence of LOF allele carriers in the Asian population.^18^ Among LOF allele carriers in Asian individuals, a substantial proportion makes up the intermediate metabolizer group.^4^ However, the differential impact between the poor and intermediate metabolizer groups remains unclear. In our study, the proportion of patients with the intermediate metabolizer phenotype was 47.8% (1391 of 2910), whereas it was 19% in the SPS3-GENES trials.^10^ Variations in the disease-specific proportions of intermediate and poor metabolizers may have influenced the observed differences in clinical efficacy. In addition to genotype, other factors have been reported to influence efficacy. High on-treatment platelet reactivity has been associated with clopidogrel response in multiple studies.^2,21,22^ Smoking is a recognized risk factor, with our findings indicating the smoker’s paradox in the incidence of cerebral infarction.^23,24,25,26^ Particularly in the CHANCE study, the high number of events was attributed to the large proportion of smokers within the Chinese population.^3,18^ Subgroup analysis showed that the efficacy of clopidogrel with aspirin therapy in reducing the risk of stroke recurrence is not present in *CYP2C19* LOF allele noncarriers with overweight or obesity.^27^ Moreover, age can influence clinical outcomes in older patients with ischemic stroke with *CYP2C19* variations.^28^ After acute ischemic stroke, there is evidence suggesting a potential association not only with long-term outcomes but also with acute phenomena, such as early neurologic deterioration or new ischemic lesions shown on magnetic resonance imaging,^12,29,30^ necessitating further research on personalized antiplatelet therapy. Further studies are necessary to consider these factors comprehensively.\n\n### Limitations\n\nOur study has some limitations. First, this study was not designed for randomization. However, it was conducted prospectively with a large cohort of patients across 37 centers in South Korea. Second, a history of cerebral infarction was recorded significantly more frequently among LOF allele carriers; however, we did not define a history of cerebral infarction and only verified it through patient history, which might have led to an overrepresentation of stroke history. Third, the follow-up duration in this study was 6 months, which limits the ability to assess the long-term effect of genotype differences; our study findings should therefore be interpreted carefully for this point. Fourth, this study was conducted exclusively in South Korea, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic groups. Further studies including multiple nationalities and ethnicities are necessary. Fifth, the association between other genetic genotypes potentially associated with clopidogrel metabolism was not analyzed. However, the most potent genetic determinant of the clopidogrel response is the *CYP2C19* LOF allele.^7,31^ Sixth, although our study enrolled patients with stroke symptoms within 72 hours of onset, we did not collect detailed data for each day (1, 2, or 3 days) or information on the clopidogrel loading dose. Consequently, our study could not provide information on the association of LOF alleles with clinical outcomes at each time point from day 1 to day 3 or according to clopidogrel loading.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this nonrandomized clinical trial, patients who were *CYP2C19* LOF allele carriers and were treated with clopidogrel had a higher likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular events after ischemic stroke than did noncarriers. Physicians may need to consider *CYP2C19* variations in patients who receive clopidogrel treatment with ischemic stroke in clinical practice.\n\n## Associated Data\n\n*This section collects any data citations, data availability statements, or supplementary materials included in this article.*\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n## References\n\n1.

It can directly, selectively and reversibly inhibit P2Y12 receptor through allosteric modulation, leading to a rapid and potent antiplatelet effect ([Teng, 2015](#ref-25)). Moreover, it reversibly blocks adenosine diphosphate (ADP) P2Y12 receptors, thus allowing the platelets activity to fully restore within three days after discontinuation of the therapy ([Kabil, Abo Dena & El-Sherbiny, 2022](#ref-11)). The instruction and previous researches indicate that ticagrelor can prevent atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or high-risk patients suffering from myocardial infarction, thereby reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke ([Bonaca et al., 2015](#ref-3)). The latest ESC guidelines recommended adding a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor to aspirin in all ACS patients; ticagrelor and prasugrel are recommended in preference to clopidogrel ([Byrne et al., 2023](#ref-4)).\n\nWhile ticagrelor has shown remarkable efficacy in benefiting numerous patients with ACS, including those with clopidogrel resistance, there are still many reports of adverse reactions. One of the most significant adverse effects is varying degrees of bleeding. In a clinical trial, major bleeding was observed in 5.4% of cases in the ticagrelor group with 1989 patients ([Schupke et al., 2019](#ref-23)). CYP3A4 is the primary metabolic enzyme responsible for ticagrelor, contributing to 95% of its metabolism ([Zhang et al., 2019](#ref-31)). Ticagrelor undergoes dealkylation at the 5th position of the cyclopentane ring, forming the active metabolite AR-C124910XX, which exhibits systemic exposure levels approximately 30–40% that of ticagrelor ([Al-Salama, Keating & Keam, 2017](#ref-1)). Studies indicated that ticagrelor plasma concentrations, but not AR-C124910XX, were associated with bleeding events in Chinese patients with acute coronary syndrome ([Yang et al., 2022](#ref-30)). [Wang et al. (2023)](#ref-27) have pointed out that ticagrelor concentration exceeding 694.90 ng/mL was an independent risk factor for bleeding in ACS patients undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy, but the concentration of AR-C124910XX and salicylic acid were not associated with bleeding risk. Dyspnea is another common side effect of ticagrelor, leading to drug discontinuation in roughly 5% treated patients ([Bonaca et al., 2015](#ref-3); [Hiatt et al., 2017](#ref-7)). A previous study supported that dyspnea is relevant to persistently higher plasma concentration of ticagrelor, but not that of AR-C124910XX ([Ortega-Paz et al., 2018](#ref-21)). Consequently, while both ticagrelor and its metabolites possess antiplatelet activity, the prevalent adverse reactions in clinical use are predominantly linked to ticagrelor plasma concentration. The possible reasons include that (1) the concentration of ticagrelor is much higher than that of AR-C124910XX; (2) the pharmacokinetic properties of ticagrelor differ from those of AR-C124910XX, including distribution and clearance ([Liu et al., 2018](#ref-17)). These findings underscore the importance of monitoring ticagrelor levels to anticipate risks of adverse reactions.\n\nCYP3A4 is the responsible metabolizing enzyme of ticagrelor, and its gene polymorphisms could result in different plasma concentrations of ticagrelor in individuals at the same dose. CYP3A4 is highly polymorphic, exhibiting significant interindividual differences in enzyme activity, as evidenced by a 43.4-fold difference reported in previous research between the donors with the highest and lowest levels ([Ohtsuki et al., 2012](#ref-20)). So far, at least 54 CYP3A4 alleles ([http://www.pharmvar.org/gene/CYP3A4](http://www.pharmvar.org/gene/CYP3A4)) have been reported and named by the Human Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Committee. The frequencies of CYP3A4 variants exhibit considerable ethnic heterogeneity ([Nicolas, Espie & Molimard, 2009](#ref-19)). For instance, [Sata et al. (2000)](#ref-22) discovered that the frequency of the CYP3A4*1B allele was 4.2% in a white population, compared to 66.7% in a black population. This allele was found to be extremely rare among Chinese individuals, with the most common allele in the Han Chinese population being CYP3A4*1G, occurring at a frequency of 24.01%, which is deemed to wild-type variant in Chinese ([Hu et al., 2017](#ref-9)). Except for the wild-type, CYP3A4*18 is the most frequent allele in Chinese populations, whereas CYP3A4*22 predominates in Canadians ([Holmberg et al., 2019](#ref-8); [Hu et al., 2017](#ref-9)). These genetic differences contribute to varying enzyme activities. Different metabolic enzyme activities are one of the most important reasons leading to treatment failure or toxic accumulation at normal doses ([Hu et al., 2017](#ref-9)). Several real-world studies have indicated that CYP3A4*22 carriers showed pronounced platelet inhibition after ticagrelor ingestion, and CYP3A4*22 variant was associated with increased risk of bleeding events in ticagrelor users ([Holmberg et al., 2019](#ref-8); [Liedes et al., 2023](#ref-15)). Therefore, understanding the individual CYP3A4 gene polymorphisms is crucial for the safe use of ticagrelor. However, as far as we know, there is no comprehensively study about the effect of CYP3A4 polymorphism on ticagrelor metabolism.\n\nIn this study, we evaluated the effect of CYP3A4*1G and 22 CYP3A4 variants, including seven new variants that specifically distributed in Chinese Han population, on ticagrelor metabolism ([Hu et al., 2017](#ref-9)). CYP3A4 gene polymorphism is an important factor in drug metabolism. Given the clinical phenomenon of a significant correlation between ticagrelor concentration and adverse reactions, special attention should be paid to poor metabolizers (PMs). We hope that these results will help to identify PMs, expand the existing database on CYP3A4 gene polymorphisms, facilitate the development of metabolic models, and provide valuable reference for predicting *in vivo* ticagrelor concentration.\n\n## Materials & Methods\n\n### Chemicals and reagents\n\nTicagrelor (99% purity) was purchased from Shanghai Canspec Scientific & Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Deshydroxyethoxy Ticagrelor (AR-C124910XX, 98% purity) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The internal standard (IS) carbamazepine (98% purity) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Company (St. Louis, Mo, USA). Reduced NADPH was supplied by Roche (Basel, Switzerland). P450 cytochrome b5 and recombinant CYP3A4 microsomes expressed in baculovirus insect cell expression system was provided by Beijing Hospital (Beijing, China) (specific methods could be gotten in our previous research) ([Liu et al., 2022](#ref-16)). HPLC-grade acetonitrile and methanol were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and formic acid from J&K (Shanghai, China). The other chemicals were of analytical grade, and all solvents were of HPLC grade. Ultrapure water was prepared *via* a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).\n\n### Incubation conditions\n\nBefore incubation system established, enzyme concentration, incubation time and gradient concentration of ticagrelor were optimized. The protein concentration of recombinant CYP3A4 microsomes was determined using the carbon monoxide binding spectrum ([Liu et al., 2022](#ref-16)). The finial incubation system was confirmed, which included ticagrelor (1–50 µM), 5 µL CYP3A4 recombinant variants, 5 µL purified cytochrome b5, and PBS buffer (100 mM, PH 7.4). After 5 min pre-incubate in a Fisher shaking water bath, NADPH (1 mM) regenerating system was added to start the reaction at 37 °C water bath. The total volume was 200 µL. After 30 min, the incubation system was immediately terminated by cooling to −80 °C. Termination error of enzyme-catalyzed reaction was controlled by controlling the speed and duration of transshipment. We transferred samples to a −80 °C freezer for 15min to freeze them completely. Thus enzyme-catalyzed reaction could not restart in subsequent operations, which could ensure consistency of this study. After 15 min, 400 µL cool acetonitrile and 25 µL carbamazepine (400 µg/mL, IS) were added to the incubation mixture. Centrifuge the sample at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C after fully vortexed. Then the supernatant 1:1 dilute with water, and 2 µL aliquot of the diluent was injected into an ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) for analysis. All samples were prepared in triplicate parallelly.\n\n### Chromatography and UHPLC-MS/MS conditions\n\nAn Agilent 1290 system was used for the chromatographic separation of analytes on an Agilent ZORBAX RRHD Eclipse Plus C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 µ). The column temperature was maintained at 30 °C. Elution consisted of 0.l% (v/v) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) were used as mobile phase to improve the peak shape and the separation efficiency. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. Gradient elution was optimized as follows: 0 min at 40% B, 0–0.5 min linear increased to 95% B, 0.5–1.5 min at 95% B, and 1.5–2.0 min linear decreased to 40% B. The total run time was 3.5 min with a stop-time of 2 min and a post-time of 1.5 min.\n\nDetection and analysis were performed by an Agilent G6420A Triple quadrupole LC/MS equipped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source. AR-C124910XX and IS were tested in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with positive mode. [M-H]+ was set as the precursor ion, and the most specific fragment ions were selected as the product ion (m/z 479.17 →153 for AR-C124910XX and m/z 237.1 →194 for IS). We set the capillary voltage at 4.0 kV, the nebulizer at 45 psi, the gas temperature at 350 °C, and nitrogen gas with a flow rate of 10L/min, respectively. Under these conditions, posttime retention times of AR-C124910XX and IS were 1.658 min and 0.859 min ([Fig. 1](#fig-1)), respectively. Data were acquired and quantified by Mass Hunter work station and Qualitative Analysis software (version B.07.00).\n\n### Figure 1.

Enzyme kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) for each variant were presented as the means ± SD from three parallel experiments. The intrinsic clearance (CLint) was determined as Vmax/Km. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 17.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to carry out statistical analysis. Prior to one-way ANOVA, the data were log-transformed to satisfy homogeneity of variance.; Levene’s test was used to evaluate homogeneity of variance; Statistically significant ANOVA results were followed by LSD post-hoc test. *p* < 0.05 represents statistically significant.\n\n## Results\n\nThe UHPLC-MS/MS method was verified with precision, accuracy, matrix effect, recovery and stability ([Tables 1](#table-1) & [2](#table-2)). The calibration curve established by linear regression model exhibited a good linear relationship over a concentration range of 5–2,000 nmol/L for AR-C 124910XX. The regression coefficients (*R*^2^) of calibration curve was above 0.99. The lower limit of quantification for AR-C124910XX was 5 nmol/L. Both the relative standard deviations (RSD) and relative errors (RE) of intraday and intreday precisions, and stability did not exceed ±15%. The recovery was 87.53%–91.29%. The matrix effect (ME) was 0.01%­-3.23%. The above results reflect that the analysis method is precise, accurate, stable, and which has a good recovery and a negligible matrix effect.\n\n### Table 1.

RSD, standard deviations; RE, relative errors\n\nBy using this approach, we assessed the catalytic activities of wild-type CYP3A4 and 22 allelic variants with substrate ticagrelor. Michaelis–Menten plots for each CYP3A4 variant were shown in [Fig. 2](#fig-2) and the corresponding kinetic parameters were summarized in [Table 3](#table-3). CYP3A4*30 (R130STOP) could not be determined because of no detectable enzymatic activity toward ticagrelor. Except for CYP3A4*30, the Michaelis–Menten kinetics of other 21 CYP3A4 variants could be determined. The estimated kinetic parameters Vmax, Km and CLint for AR-C124910XX of CYP3A4*1 were 1743.33 pmol/min/nmol, 2.18 µM and 800.45 µL/min/nmol, respectively. Almost of the variants exhibited changed Vmax or Km values compared with that of CYP3A4*1, which results in significant variations in CLint.\n\n### Figure 2.

ND, not determined.\n\nAccording to the alterations in Vmax value, three situations were observed: significant decrements in CYP3A4*17 and CYP3A4*24 compared with CYP3A4*1; no obvious differences in CYP3A4*28 and CYP3A4*29; significant increments in the other 17 variants. Km values of all variants showed statistically increased (1.46–12.84 times of the wild-type). The ratio of Vmax and Km indicates the intrinsic clearance (CLint) values, which are considered the evaluation criterion for enzymatic activity. The relative clearance values between variants and wild-type can be determined by comparing their CLint ratios. Except for CYP3A4*30, the remaining 21 CYP3A4 variants could be classified into the following three categories according to the relative clearance values compare with CYP3A4*1: CYP3A4*11, CYP3A4*18 and CYP3A4*33 showed significantly higher intrinsic clearance than that of CYP3A4*1; four CYP3A4 variants (CYP3A4*10, CYP3A4*23, CYP3A4*32 and CYP3A4*34) were not significantly different from that of wild-type; the remaining fourteen variants (CYP3A4*2-*5, *9, *14-*17, *19, *24, *28, *29, and *31,) exhibited significantly reduced CLint in different degrees (1.48%–75.11% relative clearance) compared to that of wild-type.\n\n## Discussion\n\nCYP3A4 is considered the most predominant CYP450 enzyme in the human liver and the gut. It is responsible for the metabolism of approximately 30–40% of clinically used drugs ([Hu et al., 2017](#ref-9)). CYP3A4 exhibits high polymorphism, with different enzyme activities closely related to factors such as race, genetic variation, and interactions with substrates, inhibitors, or inducers. The enzyme catalytic activity of CYP3A4 alleles can be categorized into four categories: no activity, decreased activity, normal activity and increased activity. Individuals carrying inactive or decreased active CYP3A4 alleles are referred to as poor metabolizers (PMs); while those who carry increased active CYP3A4 alleles are referred to as extensive metabolizers (EMs). Compared to normal metabolizes, PMs are more susceptible to medication side effects at normal therapeutic doses, particularly for drugs with narrow therapeutic windows or large individual variability; conversely, EMs are more likely to experience treatment failure at normal doses.\n\nResearch conducted over the past decade has revealed that while there are no significant differences in the antiplatelet efficacy of ticagrelor across different genotypes, there is substantial variation in the risk of adverse effects such as bleeding complications and dyspnea ([Ortega-Paz et al., 2018](#ref-21); [Schupke et al., 2019](#ref-23); [Wang et al., 2023](#ref-27)). This variation arises because ticagrelor and its main metabolite, AR-C124910XX, have comparable antiplatelet activity. However, the adverse effects following clinical administration of ticagrelor are correlated with the plasma concentration of ticagrelor, but not of AR-C124910XX ([Ortega-Paz et al., 2018](#ref-21); [Schupke et al., 2019](#ref-23); [Wang et al., 2023](#ref-27); [Yang et al., 2022](#ref-30)). Accurate individualized drug dosing is crucial for reducing adverse events. CYP3A4 gene polymorphism is a key factor that leads to different substrate concentrations ([Baxter et al., 2014](#ref-2)). At equivalent dosages, individuals classified as poor metabolizers (PMs) exhibit higher concentrations of ticagrelor, thereby increasing their risk of bleeding and dyspnea. In contrast, extensive metabolizers (EMs) or those with normal metabolic function have a lower likelihood of experiencing these adverse effects.\n\nCYP3A4*17 (F189S) and *24 (Q200H) exhibit severely reduced activity in the metabolism of ticagrelor, with over 90% decreased CLint compared to the wild-type. Similar reductions in metabolic activity have been observed with other substrates, such as sildenafil and ibrutinib ([Tang et al., 2020](#ref-24); [Xu et al., 2018](#ref-29)). CYP3A4*17 (F189S) is a typical activity-attenuated variant. [Dai et al. (2001)](#ref-5) predict that residue F189S is located at the end of helix E. The residue is a nonconservative mutation in a tightly packed region, which could potentially impact the conformation of the protein, substrate access, and/or catalytic activity ([Dai et al., 2001](#ref-5)). Our results provide some support for this prediction, indicating that CYP3A4*17 exhibits a markedly reduced Clint for ticagrelor, achieving only 4.72% of the activity observed in the wild-type. CYP3A4*24 (Q200H) involves an A →T nucleotide substitution in exon 7, which causes a change from glutamine to histidine at position 220. In this study, CYP3A4*24 showed feeble catalytic activity towards ticagrelor, with only 1.48% relative clearance. The precarious activity of CYP3A4*24 may be attributed to the Q200H mutation.\n\nTwelve variants (CYP3A4*2, *14, *3, *16, *5, *28, *29, *19, *4, *15, *9 and *31) also display significantly lower catalytic activity than CYP3A4*1, with relative clearance ranging from 25.52% to 75.11%. CYP3A4*2 is initially identified in a white population with a frequency of 2.7% ([Sata et al., 2000](#ref-22)), and has since been observed in the Chinese population. It involves a 15713T>C transition resulting in a Ser222Pro change. The serine to proline amino acid change could potentially affect the three-dimensional structure of the protein due to proline’s known ability to disrupt helical structures ([Lee & Goldstein, 2005](#ref-14)). Therefore, the mutation of Ser222Pro may greatly affect the substrate binding process and result in a relatively reduced catalytic activity of CYP3A4*2. In this *in vitro* study, CYP3A4*2 exhibits a 74.48% decrease in intrinsic clearance for ticagrelor when compared to the wild-type. CYP3A4*3 was first identified in Chinese subject from Shanghai ([Sata et al., 2000](#ref-22)), and it has a prevalence of 0.5% in the Uygur population in northwest China ([Jin et al., 2015](#ref-10)). It involves a 1334T>C transition leading to a missense mutation with a Met445Thr substitution in exon 12. This SNP take place within an evolutionarily conserved heme-binding region ([Sata et al., 2000](#ref-22)), potentially inducing structural variations affecting enzymatic activity. This study confirmed this point: the increase in Km is larger than that of Vmax, resulting in a 64.99% decrease in CLint for CYP3A4*3 compared with CYP3A4*1. Patients carrying these activity-impaired alleles should be classified as poor metabolizers. Previous studies have reported similar variants with reduced catalytic activity. For example, the CYP3A4*22 allele defined by the rs35599367 variant, which reduces CYP3A4 mRNA expression and enzyme activity in the liver ([Van Eerden et al., 2023](#ref-26)). Research reported an 89% higher area under the plasma concentration–time curve for ticagrelor in CYP3A4*22 carriers compared to controls, suggesting that the CYP3A4*22 carriers may reinforce the antiplatelet effect by impairing ticagrelor elimination ([Holmberg et al., 2019](#ref-8)). Thus, we speculate that carriers of the aforementioned activity-impaired variants, similar to CYP3A4*22 carriers, may exhibit higher concentrations of ticagrelor than wild-type carriers, leading to more substantial effects. Therefore, they should be more vigilant regarding adverse reactions such as bleeding and dyspnea. Patients who carry these activity-impaired alleles may require lower ticagrelor doses to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations and reduce the risk of adverse effects and toxicity.\n\nCYP3A4*11, *18, and *33 show significantly higher catalytic activities compared to the wild-type. CYP3A4*11 contains a substitution from threonine to methionine at residue 363 site. This substitution might perturb the tertiary structure of the protein in the region, resulting in instability of its catalytic function ([Eiselt et al., 2001](#ref-6)). In contrast to the current findings, [Murayama et al. (2002)](#ref-18) indicated that CYP3A4*11 exhibited reduced catalytic activity in testosterone hydroxylase activity compared with CYP3A4*1 ([Eiselt et al., 2001](#ref-6)). CYP3A4*18 is the most common nonsynonymous variant in the Han Chinese population with a frequency of 1.26% ([Hu et al., 2017](#ref-9)). CYP3A4*18 contains one nucleotide substitution (T>C) at position 878 in the cDNA, which results in an amino acid change from Leucine to Proline at position 293. Codon 293 is located at the start of the highly conserved helix I, in which the most crucial difference in the L293P secondary structural elements was observed ([Kang et al., 2009](#ref-12)). Previous *in vitro* functional studies indicate that CYP3A4*18 results in a rapid oxidation in sex steroid metabolism ([Kang et al., 2009](#ref-12)). In current study, CYP3A4*11 and CYP3A4*18 exhibit apparent increased intrinsic clearance values for ticagrelor. These different results may be explained by that the structural changes in the substrate recognition sites of the CYP450 enzyme that can cause changes in enzymatic activity.\n\nCYP3A4*30 is a novel allelic variant found in the Chinese population. In experiments involving ticagrelor incubation, the enzymatic activity of CYP3A4*30 could not be assessed. Studies have revealed that the nucleotide changes of c.388C>T (CYP3A4*30) leads to a premature termination codon at position 130, resulting in a truncated protein that lacks the catalytic domain ([Hu et al., 2017](#ref-9)). Thus, CYP3A4*30 may exhibit complete loss of function.\n\nAlmost all CYP3A4 alleles exhibit altered or decreased functions compared to wild-type. It should be noticed that one particular variant can display decreased, increased, or unchanged activities for different drugs. Namely, the substrate specificity is an important reason leading to altered characteristic of the CYP3A4 variants. Thus, it is necessary to carry out enzyme kinetics studies on different substrates.\n\nIt’s noteworthy that the clinical Cmax for ticagrelor is approximately 1 µM, which is significantly lower than the Km values of each CYP3A4 variant ([Wang et al., 2021](#ref-28)). This suggests that the *in vivo* metabolic rate of ticagrelor is far from Vmax and likely follows first-order kinetics typical of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, indicating ticagrelor is within its linear metabolic range. Poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP3A4 exhibit reduced metabolism, resulting in prolonged drug half-life and increased plasma concentrations of ticagrelor, potentially leading to higher incidence of adverse events. For the Chinese population carrying these variants, particularly PMs, understanding enzyme kinetic characteristics (such as Clint) can be useful in predicting ticagrelor toxicity and maintaining vigilance in clinical practice. Future clinical studies focusing on the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor in typical poor metabolizers are needed. Our goal in future research is to establish a drug concentration calculation model based on enzyme kinetics and pharmacokinetic characteristics to advance precision medicine.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn summary, this study provides a functional assessment of 22 recombinant CYP3A4 variants in ticagrelor metabolism. Variants in CYP3A4 exhibit substrate-specific differences, for which it is necessary to study the effect of various variants towards different substrates. Most of the variants showed markedly different enzyme catalytic activity in ticagrelor metabolism *in vitro*. The side effects in clinical of ticagrelor are correlated with the plasma concentration of ticagrelor. It demonstrates that monitoring serum concentration and adjusting ticagrelor dosage in time is vital for the patients carrying these variants to achieve sound therapeutic effects avoiding side effects. We have reason to speculate that patient’s CYP3A4 genotype may exert a meaningful impact on the therapeutic effect and side effect of ticagrelor. We hope that these results could extend the understanding of the clinical drug toxicity, and provide insights and predictions for treatment strategies and risk assessments associated with ticagrelor in clinical practice to some extent.\n\n## Supplemental Information\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank the members of the Beijing Institute of Geriatrics of the Ministry of Health for their advice and assistance.\n\n## Funding Statement\n\nThis work was supported by the Jinhua Science and Technology Bureau of project (No. 2023-3-121).

Germline DNA was genotyped using arrays. Genetic variants not genotyped directly were imputed. HLA alleles were imputed using SNP2HLA or inferred using BWAkit. Analyses between genetic variants and hypersensitivity were performed in each cohort first using cohort-specific covariates and then combined using meta-analyses. Nongenetic risk factors included fewer intrathecal injections (P = 2.7×10−5 in TXVI) and male sex (P = 0.025 in AALL0232). HLA alleles DQB1*02:02, DRB1*07:01, and DQA1*02:01 had the strongest associations with pegaspargase hypersensitivity (P < 5.0×10−5) in patients with primarily European ancestry (EA), with the three alleles associating in a single haplotype. The top allele HLA-DQB1*02:02 was tagged by HLA-DQB1 rs1694129 in EAs (r2 = 0.96) and less so in non-EAs. All single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with pegaspargase hypersensitivity reaching genome-wide significance in EAs were in class II HLA loci, and were partially replicated in non-EAs, as is true for other HLA associations. The rs9958628 variant, in ARHGAP28 (previously linked to immune response in children) had the strongest genetic association (P = 8.9×10−9) in non-EAs. The HLA-DQB1*02:02-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01 associated with hypersensitivity reactions to pegaspargase is the same haplotype associated with reactions to non-PEGylated asparaginase, even though the antigens differ between the two preparations.\n\nKeywords: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Asparaginase, Human Leukocyte Antigen, Hypersensitivity, Pharmacogenomics\n\n## Introduction\n\nAsparaginase is a crucial treatment component for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma. Hypersensitivity reaction is the primary adverse effect of both native and PEGylated *E. coli* asparaginase (ASNase and pegaspargase). Although IgG antibodies against both preparations of asparaginase have been detected and associated with reactions, we showed that antibodies against pegaspargase predominantly targeted polyethylene glycol (PEG), whereas antibodies against ASNase primarily targeted the asparaginase protein, indicating differences in the mechanisms of their immunogenicity.([1](#R1)) Efforts have been made to understand the mechanisms of these reactions and to develop effective preventative treatment based on genetic risk factors such as an *NFATC2* variant previously identified.([2](#R2)) Mutations have been introduced to *E. coli* asparaginase protein to make it less immunogenic.([3](#R3), [4](#R4)) Previously, we and others identified variations in several *HLA* loci that were associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity in children of predominantly European ancestry treated for ALL.([5](#R5)–[8](#R8)) Nevertheless, our previous study used combined cohorts consisting of patients treated with either ASNase or pegaspargase, while two other studies investigated hypersensitivity only to native ASNase. Because ASNase is no longer used in frontline therapy in major cooperative group trials in North America and the European Union, understanding the risk of hypersensitivity to pegaspargase in a cohort without ASNase treatment is needed. Here we present a genome-wide and HLA-focused analysis of genomic risk factors for hypersensitivity reactions exclusively to pegaspargase using the largest cohort of pediatric ALL and include results from multiple ancestries.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Patients and phenotype\n\nThree cohorts of ALL patients, all using pegaspargase upfront, were included in this study. One cohort was treated with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital’s Total XVI (TXVI) protocol (n = 598, B- and T-lineage ALL). The other two were treated with Children’s Oncology Group (COG) protocols: AALL0232 (n = 2472, B-ALL only) and AALL0434 (n = 1189, T-ALL only). Hypersensitivity reaction data were retrieved from research databases with reactions documented as part of the prospective toxicity reporting of each protocol (as of June 2018 for TXVI and December 2018 for COG protocols). Treatment details have been described.([1](#R1), [9](#R9), [10](#R10)) Reactions were graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3 (allergic reaction/hypersensitivity) in TXVI and CTCAE v4 (allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) in AALL0232 and AALL0434. Grade 1 reactions were defined by transient flushing/rash, drug fever < 38C° with no intervention indicated and were not requested to be reported in these trials. Therefore, in this study, patients with pegaspargase hypersensitivity reactions of grade 2 or higher were treated as reaction positive; the rest were treated as reaction negative. Associations between patient- and treatment- related variables and pegaspargase reactions were analyzed with general logistic regression. Treatment-related variables analyzed for their association with pegaspargase hypersensitivity reactions included: number of intrathecal injections during remission induction (TXVI), number of pegaspargase doses during remission induction (TXVI, or as receiving extended induction or not in AALL0232), glucocorticoid (dexamethasone vs prednisone) used in remission induction (AALL0232), number of delayed intensifications (AALL0232), methotrexate arm (AALL0232 and AALL0434), and receiving nelarabine or not (AALL0434). Informed consent from the parents or guardians and assent from the patients, as appropriate, were obtained with oversight by the local Institutional Review Boards.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nGermline DNA collected after remission induction therapy was genotyped using the Illumina Exome-24 BeadChip (596 and 2056 patients on TXVI and AALL0232 respectively), the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (596 patients on TXVI and 2275 patients on AALL0232), or the Illumina Infinium Omni2.5-exome BeadChip (1026 patients on AALL0434). Illumina Infinium Omni2.5-exome array included most the content of Illumina Exome-24 BeadChip, and the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA region that were common to both arrays were used to infer HLA alleles. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed only on TXVI germline DNA samples (n = 595). iAdmix ([11](#R11)) was used to infer genetic ancestry percentage for each patient using 1000genome data ([12](#R12)) as reference. Percent ancestry was used to assign patients to ancestry groups: patients having ≥ 90% European ancestry (EA, reference population: GBR/CEU/FIN/TSI/IBS); patients having ≥ 70% African ancestry (AA, reference population: YRI/LWK/GWD/MSL/ESN/ASW/ACB); patients having ≥ 10% Native American ancestry (AMR, reference population: PEL/CLM/PUR/MXL) and Native American ancestry being the greatest non-EA ancestry; patients having ≥ 90% East Asian (EAS, reference population: CHB/JPT/CDX/CHS/KHV) or South Asian (SAS, reference population: BEB/GIH/PJL/ITU/STU) ancestry (AS), and others whose ancestry was outside the above boundaries (Other). The principal component analysis (PCA) plot with 1000genome samples is in [Figure S1](#SD1), and the comparison between ancestry group and self-reported race/ethnicity group is in [Table S1](#SD1). We also estimated the percentage of Native American ancestry for TXVI patients using an independent cohort of Native American population with Affymetrix SNPCHIP available as reference,([13](#R13)) and the estimated percentage Native American ancestries were highly consistent (r^2^ > 0.99) with what was obtained using 1000genome as the reference population. Genetic variants not genotyped directly were imputed using the Michigan Imputation Server. SNPs were included in analyses with imputation r^2^ > 0.6 and Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium P value (within EA patients) > 0.0001 across all cohorts.\n\n### Data analysis\n\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed on all patients and within different ancestry groups (EAs, non-EAs, AAs and AMRs) for each treatment protocol adjusting for protocol-specific covariates and ancestry. Meta-analyses were performed combining results from the same ancestry group across protocols ([Figure S2](#SD1)). Additional trans-ancestry meta-analysis was performed to combine the results across multiple ancestry groups. All GWAS were performed using PLINK 2.00 alpha.([14](#R14)) All meta-analyses were performed using generic inverse variance method in PLINK 1.9 ([Figure S2](#SD1)).([15](#R15)) Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models. An OR > 1 indicates that the presence of the HLA allele, or the amino acid variant, or the minor allele of the SNP, was associated with increased risk of hypersensitivity. In all GWAS except for ones in EAs only, percentage ancestries were treated as continuous variable covariates.\n\nHLA alleles were imputed for all patients using SNP2HLA v1.0.2.([16](#R16)) EA, AA, AMR, and Other patients were imputed using T1DGC as the reference panel. AS patients were imputed using the Pan-Asian reference panel.([17](#R17)) The association between SNP2HLA-imputed HLA alleles and pegaspargase hypersensitivity reactions was analyzed in EAs, AAs, AMRs, and non-EAs within each protocol using protocol-specific covariates using PLINK 2.00 alpha. For TXVI patients, HLA alleles were also inferred from WES data using BWAkit 0.7.11,([18](#R18)) and inferred HLA alleles were compared to those obtained by SNP2HLA ([Table S2](#SD1)). The BWAkit results were not combined with SNP2HLA results in any analyses. Associations between BWAkit-inferred HLA alleles and hypersensitivity on TXVI were analyzed adjusting for the number of intrathecal injections during induction;([1](#R1)) associations in non-EAs treated on TXVI also adjusted for ancestry percentage.\n\nWe used the following for the alpha level for significance for association analyses: for HLA alleles, we used 5.2×10^−4^ (0.05/97 [number of imputed HLA alleles]); for HLA amino acids, we used 4.8×10^−5^ (0.05/1041 [number of imputed HLA amino acid variants]), and for GWAS of SNPs, we used 5×10^−8^.\n\nLocus zoom plots were made with [https://locuszoom.org/](https://locuszoom.org/).([19](#R19)) Other statistical analyses and graphics were generated using R version 3.6.\n\n## Results\n\n### Patient- and treatment-related risk factors for pegaspargase hypersensitivity reactions\n\nOf the evaluable patients ([Table 1](#T1)) in TXVI, AALL0232, and AALL0434, 13.7% (82 of 598), 15.2% (375 of 2472) and 8.2% (98 of 1189) patients had reactions to pegaspargase, respectively. As we previously reported, a higher number of intrathecal injections during remission induction was the only clinical covariate associated with lower risk of reactions to pegaspargase in TXVI (*P* = 6.4×10^−5^ OR 0.73, [Table S3A](#SD1)).([1](#R1)) Male patients were at higher risk for reactions in AALL0232 compared with females (*P* = 0.025 OR 1.24, [Table S3B](#SD1)). No patient- or treatment-related variable was associated with reactions in AALL0434 ([Table S3C](#SD1)). Risk for reactions did not differ by ancestry in all three protocols ([Table S3](#SD1)).\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Cohort | EA (%) | AA (%) | AMR (%) | AS (%) | Other (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TXVI | 402 (70.5) | 81 (13.6) | 63 (10.6) | 8 (1.3) | 42 (7.0) |\n| AALL0232 | 1295 (56.9) | 115 (5.1) | 577 (25.4) | 67 (2.9) | 221 (9.7) |\n| AALL0434 | 593 (57.8) | 114 (11.1) | 158 (15.4) | 37 (3.6) | 124 (12.1) |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Number of evaluable patients in different ancestry groups in protocols TXVI (n = 596), AALL0232 (n = 2275), and AALL0434 (n = 1026) assigned using iAdmix inferred ancestry percentage.

In a meta-analysis combining results from the three cohorts, among 97 HLA alleles, *HLA-DQB1*02:02*, *HLA-DRB1*07:01*, *HLA-DQA1*02:01, and HLA-DRB1*04:02* had the strongest association with reactions to pegaspargase (*P*_meta_ = 3.8×10^−9^ OR 2.13, *P*_meta_ = 2.2×10^−5^ OR 1.96, *P*_meta_ = 2.7×10^−5^ OR 1.96, and *P*_meta_ = 6.3×10^−5^ OR 4.61 respectively, [Table 2](#T2), [Figure 1A](#F1)); among 1041 amino acid variants, glycine at position 135 of *HLA-DQB1*, a marker for the *HLA-DQB1*02:02* allele, had the strongest association with reactions (*P*_meta_ = 3.8×10^−9^ OR 2.13, [Table S4](#SD1)). Phasing data acquired through Beagle showed that the top three alleles represent an extended haplotype in EAs (r^2^ = 1.0 between *HLA-DRB1*07:01* and *HLA-DQA1*02:01*, r^2^ = 0.73 between *HLA-DQB1*02:02* and either *HLA-DRB1*07:01* or *HLA-DQA1*02:01*, [Table S5](#SD1)). All but one patient with *HLA-DQB1*02:02* also had the extended haplotype *HLA-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02*. In multivariable analyses, none of the alleles/haplotypes remained significant after adjusting for another allele due to the extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) (*P* > 0.07, [Table S6](#SD1)). The top DRB1 amino acids do not mark *HLA-DRB1*07:01* and are not shared by the top *HLA-DRB1* allele hits (*DRB1*07:01, *04:02, and *04:05*).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| 4-digit HLA allele | Meta-analysis |  |  |  |  | TXVI |  |  | AALL0232 |  |  | AALL0434 |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| P | ORa | I2 | P.het | freq | P | ORa | freq | P | ORa | freq | P | ORa | freq |  |\n| HLA-DQB1*02:02 | 3.76E-9 | 2.14 | 0.00 | 0.695 | 0.100 | 1.44E-3 | 2.38 | 0.1 | 9.29E-5 | 1.94 | 0.095 | 1.53E-3 | 2.47 | 0.111 |\n| HLA-DRB1*07:01 | 2.22E-5 | 1.99 | 0.37 | 0.202 | 0.132 | 3.28E-5 | 2.91 | 0.133 | 3.27E-4 | 1.74 | 0.123 | 5.78E-2 | 1.70 | 0.149 |\n| HLA-DQA1*02:01 | 2.74E-5 | 1.99 | 0.39 | 0.196 | 0.132 | 3.28E-5 | 2.91 | 0.133 | 3.93E-4 | 1.73 | 0.123 | 5.20E-2 | 1.72 | 0.148 |\n| HLA-DRB1*04:02 | 6.30E-5 | 4.49 | 0.00 | 0.819 | 0.008 | 4.97E-1 | 2.22 | 0.005 | 3.02E-3 | 4.74 | 0.006 | 7.48E-3 | 5.01 | 0.013 |\n| HLA-DRB1*04:05 | 5.44E-4 | 3.75 | 0.00 | 0.711 | 0.007 | 1.78E-1 | 3.39 | 0.006 | 1.60E-2 | 3.18 | 0.009 | 2.50E-2 | 7.22 | 0.004 |\n| HLA-B*50:01 | 5.06E-3 | 3.13 | 0.00 | 0.636 | 0.008 | 2.86E-1 | 2.53 | 0.009 | 6.08E-3 | 4.07 | 0.007 | 7.55E-1 | 1.39 | 0.009 |\n| HLA-DQA1*01:03 | 5.82E-3 | 0.54 | 0.00 | 0.852 | 0.065 | 9.16E-2 | 0.41 | 0.066 | 4.20E-2 | 0.57 | 0.066 | 3.31E-1 | 0.56 | 0.063 |\n| HLA-DQB1*06:02 | 6.74E-3 | 0.66 | 0.00 | 0.708 | 0.125 | 5.07E-1 | 0.81 | 0.122 | 1.84E-2 | 0.63 | 0.124 | 1.54E-1 | 0.54 | 0.128 |\n| HLA-A*02:05 | 1.18E-2 | 3.03 | 0.00 | 0.967 | 0.006 | 3.54E-1 | 3.08 | 0.006 | 2.63E-2 | 3.20 | 0.007 | 4.37E-1 | 2.34 | 0.006 |\n| HLA-B*38:01 | 1.79E-2 | 1.9 | 0.00 | 0.952 | 0.020 | 3.69E-1 | 1.86 | 0.015 | 7.10E-2 | 1.82 | 0.022 | 2.01E-1 | 2.28 | 0.019 |\n| HLA-DQA1*01:01 | 1.81E-2 | 0.71 | 0.02 | 0.360 | 0.147 | 6.16E-2 | 0.54 | 0.144 | 3.71E-2 | 0.69 | 0.141 | 9.71E-1 | 1.01 | 0.161 |\n| HLA-DPA1*02:02 | 3.14E-2 | 1.59 | 0.00 | 0.658 | 0.033 | 9.96E-1 | 1.00 | 0.032 | 2.62E-2 | 1.75 | 0.038 | 4.69E-1 | 1.58 | 0.025 |\n| HLA-DRB1*13:01 | 3.17E-2 | 0.61 | 0.00 | 0.629 | 0.059 | 1.43E-1 | 0.46 | 0.058 | 1.88E-1 | 0.70 | 0.059 | 1.97E-1 | 0.39 | 0.058 |\n| HLA-DRB1*15:01 | 4.05E-2 | 0.71 | 0.14 | 0.313 | 0.132 | 9.49E-1 | 1.02 | 0.134 | 1.50E-2 | 0.63 | 0.134 | 1.57E-1 | 0.55 | 0.126 |\n| HLA-DQB1*06:03 | 4.62E-2 | 0.66 | 0.00 | 0.649 | 0.064 | 6.43E-1 | 0.84 | 0.072 | 7.96E-2 | 0.62 | 0.065 | 2.13E-1 | 0.40 | 0.057 |\n| HLA-C*07:02 | 4.87E-2 | 0.78 | 0.00 | 0.829 | 0.160 | 6.62E-1 | 0.89 | 0.158 | 8.06E-2 | 0.75 | 0.157 | 3.14E-1 | 0.71 | 0.166 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Four-digit HLA alleles significantly (P < 0.05) associated with hypersensitivity reactions to pegaspargase in EAs (n = 2168) in meta-analysis.

P = 5.2×10−4 was used as HLA allele-wide cut-off for statistical significance based on the total number of alleles in meta-analysis result (n = 97). B) Genome-wide association between SNP genotypes and hypersensitivity reaction to pegaspargase in all patients (all ancestries, n = 3897): meta-analysis from individual analyses on TXVI (adjusting for number of intrathecal treatment doses during remission induction, and ancestry percentage), AALL0232 (adjusting for sex and ancestry percentage), and AALL0434 (adjusting for ancestry percentage). C) Genome-wide association between SNP genotypes and hypersensitivity reaction to pegaspargase in EAs (n = 2168): meta-analysis from individual analyses on TXVI (adjusting for number of intrathecal treatment doses during remission induction), AALL0232 (adjusting for sex), and AALL0434. D) Genome-wide association between SNP genotypes and hypersensitivity reactions to pegaspargase in non-EAs (n = 1607): meta-analysis from individual analyses on TXVI (adjusting for number of intrathecal treatment doses during remission induction, and ancestry percentage), AALL0232 (adjusting for sex and ancestry percentage), and AALL0434 (adjusting for ancestry percentage).\n\n### HLA alleles in non-EA patients\n\nWES data available for TXVI patients was used for direct assignment of HLA alleles (*HLA-DRB1*07:01*, *HLA-DQA1*02:01* and *HLA-DQB1*02:02*) in this cohort, including 194 non-EA patients. Among the three top predictive HLA alleles in EAs, none had significant associations with reactions in TXVI non-EA patients after adjusting for ancestry percentage and number of intrathecal injections (*P* = 0.42, 0.36, and 0.96 for *HLA-DRB1*07:01, -DQA1*02:01*, and *-DQB1*02:02*). Within TXVI, inferred *HLA* alleles with *P* < 0.05 among non-EAs, with corresponding P values in EAs, are shown in [Table S7](#SD1): none of the associations for HLA alleles in non-EAs were replicated in EAs.\n\nIn order to examine HLA alleles in all ancestry groups in all protocols, not just TXVI with its WES data, we imputed HLA alleles in the combined cohort of 3775 patients with Illumina chip array genotype from all three protocols ([Table S8](#SD1)). Because SNP2HLA imputation using the EA T1DGC reference panel has been shown to have > 90% accuracy for class II HLA genes in an AA population,([21](#R21)) we also imputed HLA alleles in non-EA patients (AA, AMR, and Other) using SNP2HLA, although SNP2HLA may not have performed well for estimating HLA alleles in non-EA patients ([Table S2](#SD1)). None of the imputed alleles reached the significance threshold after multiple testing adjustment, but *HLA-DRB1*07:01*, *HLA-DQA1*02:01* and *HLA-DQB1*02:02* reached nominal significance in non-EA patients (*P*_meta_ = 0.011 OR 1.94, *P*_meta_ = 0.024 OR 2.09, and *P*_meta_ = 0.041 OR 1.75 respectively, [Table S8](#SD1)).\n\n### GWAS of SNPs in patients of all ancestries\n\nTo look for genetic variants in addition to HLA alleles associated with hypersensitivity, genome-wide analyses of Illumina typed and Michigan-imputed genotypes passing QC were performed for all patients (all ancestries) in each individual cohort adjusting for percent ancestries and cohort-specific covariates. In a meta-analysis combining results from the three cohorts, all genome-wide significant variants fell in the *HLA-DRB1* and *-DQA1* loci on chromosome 6 (*P*_meta_ < 5×10^−8^, [Table S9](#SD1), [Figure 1B](#F1)). The top hit rs28383308 (*P*_meta_ = 4.9×10^−14^ OR 1.95) locates 9173bp 5’ of the *HLA-DQA1* gene. Among EA patients rs28383308 tags *HLA-DRB1*07:01* (r^2^ = 0.85) and *HLA-DQB1*02:02* to a lesser extent (r^2^ = 0.62, [Table S10A](#SD1)). LD between rs28383308 and *HLA-DQA1*02:01* is the same as that with *HLA-DRB1*07:01* due to the complete linkage between the two alleles. Additionally, we performed GWAS adjusting for top five principal components for ancestry, and the results of top variants are consistent with the results adjusting for percent ancestries (r^2^ > 0.99, [Figure S3](#SD1)).\n\nWe also performed GWASs within ancestry groups. In a meta-analysis of EA patients in these protocols, all genome-wide significant variants fell in the *HLA-DQA1* and *-DQB1* locus on chromosome 6 (*P*_meta_ < 5×10^−8^, [Table S11](#SD1), [Figure 1C](#F1)). The top hit rs1694129 (*P*_meta_ = 1.1×10^−8^, OR 2.03) locates 1582 bp 5’ of the *HLA-DQB1* gene in a histone-binding site. rs1694129 tags *HLA-DQB1*02:02*, the top hit among imputed 4-digit *HLA* alleles in EAs (r^2^ = 0.96, [Table S10B](#SD1)). The same analysis adjusting for *HLA-DQB1*02:02* or *HLA-DRB1*07:01* did not yield any genome-wide significant variants, indicating a high level of LD between these individual SNPs and the top HLA alleles ([Figure S4](#SD1)).\n\nSimilar SNP-based GWAS and meta-analyses were conducted in combined non-EA (n = 1607), AA (n = 310), and AMR (n = 798) patients adjusting for genetic ancestry. Among non-EAs, rs9958628, located in the 5’-UTR of the Rho GTPase activating protein 28 (*ARHGAP28*) gene transcript, was the top genetic variant and reached genome-wide significance in its association with hypersensitivity (*P*_meta_ = 8.9×10^−9^, OR 3.69, [Figure 1D](#F1), [Table S12](#SD1)). This SNP was also the top non-HLA hit among all evaluable patients (*P*_meta_ = 1.2×10^−7^, OR 3.03, [Figure 1B](#F1)) and was associated with reactions in a meta-analysis in AAs from the three cohorts (*P* = 0.010 in TXVI, *P* = 0.039 in AALL0232, and *P* = 0.0015 in AALL0434, *P*_meta_ = 3.2×10^−5^, OR 2.03) but not in EAs or AMRs, plausibly due to low minor allele frequency (< 1%). The other two genome-wide significant hits among non-EAs were rs79377225 and rs11739459, located 43kb and 39kb 3’ of GC-rich promoter binding protein 1 (*GPBP1*) (*P*_meta_ = 2.5×10^−8^, OR 2.70 and *P*_meta_ = 2.7×10^−8^, OR 2.50 respectively, [Figure 1D](#F1), [Table S12](#SD1)). Some variants in the *HLA-DRA* locus, although they did not reach genome-wide significance, were also associated with reactions ([Table S12](#SD1), [Figure 1D](#F1)). No genetic variants reached genome-wide significance in meta-analyses of AAs or AMRs ([Tables S13](#SD1)&[S14](#SD1), [Figure S5](#SD1)). In addition, we performed trans-ancestry meta-analysis based on the ancestry specific analyses. rs11739459 and rs79377225 remained genome-wide significant ([Table S15](#SD1), *P*_meta_ = 8.8×10^−9^ OR 2.60 and *P*_meta_ = 1.6×10^−8^ OR 2.74 respectively).\n\nNext, we examined if the tagging SNPs for the significant imputed HLA alleles in EA patients were also significant in non-EAs. The top SNP rs1694129 in EAs remained nominally significantly associated with pegaspargase reactions in non-EA patients, adjusting for percent ancestry (*P*_meta_ = 0.013, OR 2.01, [Table S11](#SD1)). This SNP well tags *HLA-DQB1*02:02* in EAs (r^2^ = 0.96), but only moderately tags *HLA-DRB1*07:01* (r^2^ = 0.55) and *HLA-DQB1*02:02* (r^2^ = 0.52) in non-EAs based on TXVI WES data (n = 194). The same SNP did not reach statistical significance when analyzed in AAs only (*P*_meta_ = 0.14) or AMRs only (*P*_meta_ = 0.15), likely due to the limit of smaller sample size, although the association was in the same direction as in EAs. There was some degree of heterogeneity across ancestry groups for this SNP but it did not reach statistical significance (I^2^ = 0.54, P.het = 0.11) The differences in HLA SNPs associated with pegaspargase reactions by ancestry groups are reflected in the locus zoom plots on a region on chromosome 6 covering major class II HLA genes (*HLA-DRA, -DRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1,* and *-DPB1*) ([Figure 2](#F2)). Top HLA hits in all patients (all ancestries) mainly overlap with those in EAs, probably because EA patients made up most of the three cohorts ([Table 1](#T1)). The top HLA hit in non-EA patients *HLA-DRA* rs9268670 did not replicate in EAs (*P*_meta_ = 0.066), although the direction of association was the same. Top HLA hits in all non-EAs overlap with those in AMRs, both in the *HLA-DRA* loci. SNPs in the HLA region seem to have the weakest contribution to risk for pegaspargase reactions in AAs. None of the SNPs in the class I HLA loci had stronger associations than the top hits in class II HLA loci.\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e4ee/8790808/d05c655476f7/nihms-1765892-f0002.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=8790808_nihms-1765892-f0002.jpg)\n\nLocus zoom plot showing the SNPs in the major class II HLA genes on chromosome 6. The purple diamond indicates the top class II HLA SNP in this region. Other SNPs analyzed in this region were colored by linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the top hit. LD was calculated based on populations with European ancestry.\n\n## Discussion\n\nPegaspargase and native ASNase differ in their risk of causing hypersensitivity reactions, the severity of the reactions, and the major epitope targeted by anti-ASP antibodies that mediate the reactions.([1](#R1)) Two previous studies associated native ASNase hypersensitivity with the *HLA-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02* haplotype in pediatric ALL cohorts with predominantly European ancestry.([5](#R5), [6](#R6)) In this report, we analyzed associations between HLA alleles and pegaspargase hypersensitivity in the largest cohort so far of patients exclusively treated with pegaspargase as first line therapy, and our patients were ancestrally diverse. Although predominantly mediated by antibodies against PEG, not the asparaginase protein,([1](#R1)) hypersensitivity reactions to pegaspargase were strongly associated with the same HLA haplotype as in the case of ASNase. Interestingly, Gagne et al attributed the high risk of this haplotype mainly to the presence of *DQB1*02:02*, not the other two alleles.([6](#R6)) Analysis of our cohorts showed similar results ([Table 2](#T2), [Figure 1A](#F1), [2](#F2) & [3](#F3)): *HLA-DQB1*02:02* had a lower P value than the other two alleles ([Table 2](#T2), *P*_meta_ = 3.8×10^−9^ vs. 2.2×10^−5^ and 2.7×10^−5^) and was the only allele significantly associated with reactions in all three cohorts. *HLA-DRB1*07:01* only increased the risk for reactions when accompanied by *-DQB1*02:*02 (*P* = 0.45 vs *P* = 2.0×10^−7^, [Figure 3](#F3)). Patients harboring the full haplotype with all three of *HLA-DRB1*07:01*, *-DQA1*02:01* and -*DQB1*02:02* tended to be at higher risk for reactions than those who only had *-DRB1*07:01* and *-DQA1*02:01* but not *-DQB1*02:02* (21.3% vs 13.7%, *P* = 0.061, [Figure 3](#F3)). A study on type I diabetes also found that the effect of *HLA-DRB1*07:01* relied on the *DQB1* allele it shared a haplotype with.([22](#R22)) However in multivariable analyses, we could not statistically distinguish which of the three alleles or haplotype was dominant due to the extended LD. On the HLA amino acid level, the top amino acid variant associated with reactions marks *HLA-DQB1*02:02*, while none of the top DRB1 amino acid variants mark *HLA1-DRB1*07:01*, further supporting the importance of the DQB1 over the DRB1 allele. After adjusting for *HLA-DQB1*02:02*, the top amino acid was no longer significant and no additional amino acid was significantly associated with reactions adjusting for multiple testing (alpha = 0.05/1041 of AA). Moreover, the top DRB1 amino acids are not shared by the top *HLA-DRB1* allele hits (*HLA-DRB1*07:01*, **04:02*, and **04:05*), and therefore the mechanism of association is not readily explained by the coded amino acids.\n\n### Figure 3.\n\n![Figure 3.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e4ee/8790808/b9541919551f/nihms-1765892-f0003.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=8790808_nihms-1765892-f0003.jpg)\n\nDistribution of HLA-DRB1*07:01 and HLA-DRB1*0701-DQB1*02:02 combinations in ALL patients in our combined cohort with and without hypersensitivity reactions (EA patients only, n = 2167, one patient who was HLA-DRB1*07:01-/DQA1*02:01+/DQB1*02:02+ was excluded): Patients with the full HLA-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02 haplotype tended to have higher risk for reactions compared with ones with only the partial haplotype HLA-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01 (P = 0.061). P values were generated from Chi-square test.\n\nWe are the first to interrogate genetic risk factors for asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions in non-EA patients as separate ancestry groups. Our results identified *ARHGAP28* rs9958628 as the top genetic variant associated with pegaspargase hypersensitivity in non-EAs with genome-wide significance. The same SNP was also the top non-HLA hit in all patients. Interestingly, variants in the *ARHGAP28* locus were associated with poor response to corticosteroid treatment in asthma patients, especially non-EA children, indicating the immune regulatory function of this locus.([23](#R23), [24](#R24))\n\nUsing BWAkit-inferred HLA alleles in the relatively small number of non-EAs enrolled on the TXVI protocol (who had available WES data), HLA alleles highly associated with reactions in EA patients did not replicate in non-EA patients ([Table S7](#SD1)). However, using SNP2HLA-imputed HLA alleles on all three cohorts, the imputed alleles associated with reactions in EA patients did replicate in non-EA patients ([Table S8](#SD1)), but the imputation had lower accuracy than in EA patients ([Table S2](#SD1)). When limited to SNPs (rather than alleles), the top SNP *HLA-DQB1* rs1694129 associated with pegaspargase hypersensitivity reactions in EAs also replicated in non-EAs (*P*_meta_ = 0.013 OR 2.01, [Table S11](#SD1)). Of the 82 SNPs in the *HLA* loci associated with pegaspargase hypersensitivity in EAs with meta-analysis P values ≤ 10^−6^, 27 were nominally significant (*P*_meta_ < 0.05) in non-EAs. Of the 8 SNPs in the *HLA* loci associated with pegaspargase hypersensitivity in non-EAs with meta-analysis P values ≤ 10^−6^, 3 were nominally significant (*P*_meta_ < 0.05) in EAs ([Table S12](#SD1)). Studies on the role of HLA alleles in other diseases, including hematological malignancies and infectious diseases, in different ancestries also revealed shared risk variants as well as substantial ancestry-specific HLA associations.([25](#R25)–[28](#R28)) Better understanding of the alleles and other genetic variants in the *HLA* loci in hypersensitivity for pegaspargase and other drugs and their difference by ancestry need to be further investigated in additional cohorts with HLA typing available across ancestries.\n\nDifferent from the study of Kutszegi et al,([5](#R5)) we found that T-ALL patients had a higher frequency of the high risk HLA alleles than B-lineage ALL patients in our cohorts ([Figure S6](#SD1)). Although we observed fewer reactions among EA patients in the AALL0434 cohort (all with T-ALL) than other protocol cohorts (*P* = 1.1×10^−7^ vs. AALL0232, *P* = 9.4×10^−6^ vs. TXVI), we cannot conclude that T-ALL patients were at lower or higher risk for this toxicity because: 1) treatment among the three cohorts differed, especially in intrathecal therapy, radiotherapy, and the use of nelarabine; 2) risk for hypersensitivity did not differ by lineage within the TXVI cohort (*P* = 0.99 adjusting for intrathecal therapy); 3) adverse event reporting practice may have differed among protocols. The same group also identified the combination of rs28383172 and rs7775228 as a tag for the risk HLA haplotype.([29](#R29)) This is also true in EAs in our study: 98.3% (403 out of 410) of the carriers of minor alleles for both SNPs harbored the risk HLA haplotype; 99.7% (1753 out of 1758) of the rest were absent for the risk haplotype. Both SNPs were associated with reactions in EAs in our study (*P*_meta_ = 2.9×10^−4^ and 3.9×10^−5^ for rs28383172 and rs7775228, respectively).\n\nLimitations of our study include that the results from the primary cohort were not formally replicated in any individual cohort. HLA allele inference in non-EAs is not based on strong population data. We acknowledge that some protocol-specific treatments, such as glucocorticoid used during remission induction, radiotherapy regimen, and methotrexate regimen, were not consistent across the three cohorts and could impact hypersensitivity. Information on actual therapy delivered was only available for the TXVI protocol. Genotyping methods differed among the three protocols because of the large scale and duration of the study, although potential biases were minimized by our meta-analysis approach.\n\nIn summary, the *HLA-DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02* haplotype was associated with hypersensitivity to pegaspargase. The same haplotype was previously associated with reactions to non-PEGylated ASNase.([5](#R5), [6](#R6)) This study demonstrated for the first time the association between a non-HLA locus (*ARHGAP28*) and pegaspargase hypersensitivity with genome-wide significance in non-EAs. The role of this locus in immune response and how HLA loci contribute to pegaspargase hypersensitivity in non-EAs require further investigation.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n### What is the current knowledge on the topic?\n\n### What is the current knowledge on the topic?\n\n### What is the current knowledge on the topic?\n\n### What is the current knowledge on the topic?\n\nHLA haplotype *DRB1*07:01-DQA1*02:01-DQB1*02:02* was associated with higher risk for asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions in -European-ancestry (EA) dominant cohorts treated with native *E. coli* asparaginase (ASNase) only or both ASNase and polyethylene-glycol conjugated asparaginase (pegaspargase).\n\n### What question did this study address?\n\nWhich HLA alleles and non-HLA genetic variants contribute to hypersensitivity reactions exclusively to pegaspargase? In an ancestrally diverse cohort, are there ancestry-related differences in these associations?\n\n### What this study adds to our knowledge?\n\nThe same HLA haplotype harboring the *DRB1*07:01, DQA1*02:01*, and *DQB1*02:02* alleles also associated with higher risk for hypersensitivity reactions exclusively to pegaspargase in EA patients. Non-HLA genetic variants associated with reactions at genome-wide significance were found at the *ARHGAP28* locus in non-EAs, but not in EAs.\n\n### How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science?\n\nIn this largest cohort study of ancestrally diverse patients treated with pegaspargase, the frontline asparaginase now, we show that ancestry groups differ in their genetic predisposition to allergy. By implicating *HLA* loci as well as *ARHGAP28*, further studies can focus on the mechanisms underlying allergy to pegaspargase and possibly other drugs by ancestry.\n\n## Funding information:\n\nThis research was supported by NIH grant(s) NIH P50 115279, GM NCI P30 CA 21765, R01 CA 142665, investigator-initiated research funding from Servier, and ALSAC.

A clinical study has indicated that the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 polymorphism is associated with neutropenia during nal-IRI/FL treatment; however, no studies have reported risk factors for the occurrence of adverse events in the clinical setting. This study aimed to explore the risk factors for adverse events of nal-IRI/FL.\n\n**Patients and Methods:** \nThis study included patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who started nal-IRI/FL treatment. Patient information, including laboratory data before nal-IRI/FL initiation and adverse events during nal-IRI/FL treatment, was retrospectively obtained from medical records.\n\n**Results:** \nThis study consisted of 36 patients, including 16, 16, and 4 with UGT1A1*6 or *28 wild-type (–/–), heterozygous (+/–), and homozygous (+/+), respectively. Patients with UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) exhibited significantly lower nadir counts of white blood cells (p=0.033) and neutrophils (p=0.043). Multiple regression analyses revealed that the decreased white blood cell count was significantly associated with the genotype of UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) (p=0.009), high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value before the therapy (p=0.019), and pancreatic head cancer (p=0.030). Also, the decreased neutrophil count was significantly related to the genotype of UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) (p=0.017).\n\n**Conclusion:** \nPatients with UGT1A1*6 or *28 (+/+) should be especially concerned about neutropenia and leukopenia during nal-IRI/FL treatment. Additionally, high AST value and pancreatic head cancer may be risk factors for leukopenia during nal-IRI/FL treatment.\n\nKeywords: Nanoliposomal irinotecan, metastatic pancreatic cancer, risk factor, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1\n\n### Background/Aim\n\nThe regimen with nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil and L-leucovorin (nal-IRI/FL) is used for metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Additionally, high AST value and pancreatic head cancer may be risk factors for leukopenia during nal-IRI/FL treatment.\n\n## Patients and Methods\n\n*Ethics. *This study was designed and implemented under the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, and was approved by the Wakayama Medical University Ethics Committee (No. 3,828). Information regarding the conduct of the study was disclosed on the website, and the research participants were given the option to refuse study participation.\n\n*Patient and safety evaluation. *Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, who started nal-IRI/FL treatment at Wakayama Medical University Hospital, were retrospectively recruited from June 2021 to May 2022. Patient backgrounds, including the laboratory data before nal-IRI/FL initiation, were collected from the electronic medical records. White blood cell count nadir, neutrophil count nadir, and onset of diarrhea were evaluated during nal-IRI/FL treatment and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.\n\n*Statistical analysis. *Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS^®^ Statistics 28.0; IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was used for all statistical analyses. Data are expressed as the number of patients or the median with an interquartile range. Kruskal–Wallis tests and the post hoc Mann–Whitney *U*-tests with a Bonferroni correction were used to compare the medians of continuous values among groups, whereas chi-square tests were utilized to test categorical data distribution. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors affecting the onset of diarrhea, in which the onset of diarrhea was the dependent variable and all the independent variables with *p*-values of <0.2 defined in the univariate logistic regression analysis were tested. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify factors related to the nadir count of white blood cell and neutrophil, in which the nadir count was the dependent variable and the independent variables with *p*-values of <0.2 defined in the single regression analysis were selected and tested. *p*-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n## Results\n\nThirty six patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer were recruited in this study. [Table I](#T1) summarizes the characteristics of patients who received nal-IRI/FL treatment. There were 16, 16, and four patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* wild-type (–/–), heterozygous (+/–), and homozygous (+/+) genotypes, respectively. The *UGT1A1*6* and **28* alleles were detected in three and 12 patients in the *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/–) group, respectively, and the allele detail of one patient was unknown. The *UGT1A1*6*/**6*, **6*/**28*, and **28*/**28* genotypes were detected in one, one, and two patients in the *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+) group, respectively. Patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+) showed higher total bilirubin levels in their pretreatment stages. The initial nal-IRI doses of patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (–/–), (+/–), and (+/+) were 56 (56-56), 56 (48-67), and 48 (40-49) mg/m^2^ (median with the interquartile range), respectively. The prescribed nal-IRI doses for patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+) were lower than those for other patients (*p*=0.011). Conversely, factors other than total bilirubin level and initial nal-IRI dose were not significantly different among the *UGT1A1 *genotype groups.\n\n### Table I. Patient characteristics.\n\nTable Caption: Data are expressed as the number of patients or median with interquartile range in parentheses. aKruskal-Wallis test. bChi-square test. UGT: Uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase; nal-IRI: nanoliposomal irinotecan; nal-IRI/FL: nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil and L-leucovorin; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ALT: alanine aminotransferase; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate.\n\nDiarrhea during nal-IRI/FL treatment was observed in seven (24.1%) of 29 patients, who had not been prescribed any antidiarrhea medication at the commencing time of nal-IRI. The rest of seven patients were excluded, since they received loperamide for diarrhea symptoms at the start of therapy. The incidence of grade ≥1 diarrhea in patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (–/–), (+/–), and (+/+) were 27.3%, 21.4%, and 25.0%, respectively ([Figure 1](#F1)). Multivariate analysis did not extract any risk factors, which significantly affected the development of diarrhea possibly induced by nal-IRI/FL ([Table II](#T2)).\n\n### Figure 1. Influence of UGT1A1 genotype on diarrhea during nal-IRI/FL treatment. Seven cases were excluded, since they received loperamide for diarrhea symptoms at the start of nal-IRI/FL treatment.

Predictive factors for diarrhea during nal-IRI/FL treatment.\n\nTable Caption: The predictive factors for diarrhea during nal-IRI/FL treatment were evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis using patient characteristics with p-values of <0.2 in the univariate logistic regression analyses. 95%CI: 95% confidence interval.\n\nThe nadir counts of white blood cells in patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (–/–), (+/–), and (+/+) were 3,340 (2,950–5,120), 3,220 (2,520-3,923), and 2,050 (1,550-2,513)/mm^3^, respectively (median with the interquartile range) ([Figure 2](#F2)A). The nadir counts of neutrophil in patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (–/–), (+/–), and (+/+) were 1,930 (1,540-2,782), 1,285 (1,093-2,113), and 860 (407-1,616)/mm^3^, respectively (median with the interquartile range) (Figure 2B). The nadir counts of white blood cells and neutrophils were significantly lower in patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+) (*p*=0.033, 0.043, respectively) (Figure 2A and B). Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and neutropenia in the *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+) group demonstrated an incidence rate of 50.0%, indicating a higher tendency than those in *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (–/–) and (+/–) groups at 7.1% and 12.5%, respectively (*p*=0.085 for each) (Figure 2C and D). Multiple regression analyses revealed that the *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+) genotype, high AST value before the nal-IRI/FL therapy, and pancreatic head cancer were significantly associated with decreased white blood cell count (*p*=0.009, 0.019, and 0.030, respectively) ([Table III](#T3)), and that of *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+) was significantly related to decreased neutrophil count (*p*=0.017) ([Table IV](#T4)).\n\n### Figure 2.

A previous study has revealed a significantly higher incidence of grade ≥3 diarrhea in patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* homozygosity/compound heterozygosity than in those with single heterozygosity/wild type at 33.3% *versus* 9.5%, respectively ([16](#R16)). This study surveyed the incidence of grade ≥1 diarrhea, and we excluded seven cases because of regular loperamide administration from the start of nal-IRI/FL. This exclusion is necessary to accurately assess the adverse effects of nal-IRI/FL, but the influence of the *UGT1A1* polymorphism might not have been detected due to the small sample size.\n\nBy this study, we identified a 14.7% incidence rate of grade ≥3 neutropenia during nal-IRI/FL treatment, although an incidence of 45.7% of grade ≥3 neutropenia has been reported by a Japanese phase 2 trial ([10](#R10)). The standard nal-IRI/FL regimen consists of 70 mg/m^2^ nal-IRI, 200 mg/m^2^ L-leucovorin, and 2,400 mg/m^2^ 5-FU, and patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+) should be prescribed nal-IRI at a 20 mg/m^2^ dose reduction ([15](#R15)). However, as shown in this study, the dose and its reduction were at the attending physician’s discretion rather than the standard reduction rule (Table I). Thus, the lower incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia found in this study might be associated with a reduced treatment dose. The incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia in a previous study has been reported to be significantly higher in patients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* homozygosity/compound heterozygosity than in those with single heterozygosity/wild type; occurrence rates are 73.3 and 38.1%, respectively ([16](#R16)). Patients with *UGT1A1*6* and **28* genotypes have demonstrated decreased metabolic activity ([12](#R12),[13](#R13)). In particular, the phase 1 studies of nal-IRI-based therapy have indicated that patients with *UGT1A1*6/*28* show a higher area under the plasma concentration–time curve of SN-38 than that of the other patients and experience grade 4 neutropenia ([17](#R17),[18](#R18)). The neutropenia is associated with unencapsulated SN-38 maximum plasma concentration (C_max_), and Asians show higher unencapsulated SN-38 C_max _compared with Caucasians in a pharmacokinetic analysis ([19](#R19)). Nal-IRI is less toxic than conventional irinotecan *in vivo* ([20](#R20)). The grade ≥3 neutropenia and leukopenia in the *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+) group exhibited a high incidence (Figure 2), indicating that unencapsulated SN-38 C_max_ might have been increased in this group.\n\nThe results of this study revealed that increased AST value before the nal-IRI/FL therapy and pancreatic head cancer were significantly associated with leukopenia (Table III). A previous study on FOLFIRINOX, which includes conventional irinotecan and provides similar prognoses to nal-IRI/FL as second-line therapy ([21](#R21)), has revealed the significant risk factor of grade 4 neutropenia: tumor location in the head of the pancreas (odds ratio=1.96) ([22](#R22)). Biliary obstruction due to a tumor in the head of the pancreas increases bilirubin levels, and total bilirubin higher than the upper limit of normal range is also a risk factor for grade 4 neutropenia ([23](#R23)). We believe that biliary obstruction and decreased liver function before nal-IRI/FL initiation might be associated with developing leukopenia through elevated unencapsulated SN-38 C_max_. There are many reports on predictors of treatment-response by nal-IRI-based therapy. In particular, CAR, NLR, GPS, total bilirubin, carcinomatosis, and previous treatment with irinotecan have been significantly associated with overall survival ([3](#R3)-[8](#R8)). However, no study has reported the risk factors for the adverse events during nal-IRI/FL treatment based on the analysis of factors other than the *UGT1A1* polymorphism in clinical settings. The results of this study indicated that *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+), high AST value before the nal-IRI/FL therapy and pancreatic head cancer may be risk factors for myelosuppression during nal-IRI/FL treatment (Table III, Table IV).\n\n*This study has several limitations. *This is a retrospective study based on medical records. Further, we did not measure the plasma concentration of irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38. Therefore, a prospective study with a larger number of patients needs to clarify the influence of factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of nal-IRI.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPatients with *UGT1A1*6* or **28* (+/+) should be especially concerned about neutropenia and leukopenia during nal-IRI/FL treatment. Further, high AST value and pancreatic head cancer may be risk factors for leukopenia during nal-IRI/FL treatment.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe Authors declare no competing interests in relation to this study.\n\n## Authors’ Contributions\n\nConceptualization: T.I. and M.S.; Data curation: T.I., H.E., S.H., K.K., and S.S.; Formal analysis: T.I. and M.S.; Supervision: R.A., M.K., and K.M.; Writing – original draft: T.I., M.S., and K.M.; Writing – review & editing: R.A. and M.K.; All Authors read and approved the final manuscript.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe Authors would like to thank Enago (www.enago.jp) for the English language review.\n\n## Funding\n\nNo external funding was received for this study.\n\n## References\n\n1.

HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 have been identified as predictive genetic markers for CBZ hypersensitivity in Asian and European patients. To replicate these genetic associations in pediatric patients from North America with a diverse ethnic background, we investigated HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 in 42 children with CBZ hypersensitivity, and 91 CBZ-tolerant children from across Canada. HLA-A*31:01 was significantly associated with CBZ-HSS (odds ratio (OR): 26.4, p=0.0025) and maculopapular exanthems (OR: 8.6, p=0.0037), but not with CBZ-SJS. Conversely, HLA-B*15:02 was associated with CBZ-SJS (OR: 38.6, p=0.002), but not HSS and maculopapular exanthems. This study is the first to demonstrate the association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ hypersensitivity in children, providing important replication of this association and highlighting the importance of HLA-A*31:01 as a predictive biomarker across various ancestries.\n\nKeywords: HLA-A*31:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA, carbamazepine, drug hypersensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, rash, adverse drug reaction, pharmacogenetics\n\n## Introduction\n\nCarbamazepine (CBZ) is one of the most frequently used anticonvulsants in adults and children ([1](#R1), [2](#R2)) for the treatment of epilepsy, trigeminal neuralgia, and bipolar disorder. In particular, CBZ and its derivative oxcarbazepine (OXC) are the drugs of choice in the treatment of complex partial seizures in children ([3](#R3), [4](#R4)).\n\nCBZ-induced hypersensitivity reactions of varying clinical presentation and severity ([5](#R5)–[8](#R8)) are common and occur in approximately 3–10% of patients ([9](#R9)–[11](#R11)) with similar frequencies reported for adults and children ([12](#R12), [13](#R13)). The majority of hypersensitivity reactions are relatively mild skin rashes that often require the discontinuation of CBZ for symptoms to resolve ([9](#R9)–[11](#R11)). However, CBZ also causes severe and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, which include the Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) spectrum ([14](#R14)–[16](#R16)), and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS) ([17](#R17)). SJS/TEN is characterized by a blistering rash and hemorrhagic erosions of mucous membranes, with TEN being the more severe form with more extensive skin detachment ([18](#R18)). HSS is characterized by a skin eruption, fever, and involvement of at least one internal organ, most frequently the liver ([17](#R17), [18](#R18)). Even though rare, the morbidity and mortality associated with these dramatic hypersensitivity reactions is substantial (long term complications in 45% and mortality of 2% in children with SJS/TEN; mortality of up to 10% for SJS and HSS, and up to 50% for TEN in adults) ([19](#R19)–[22](#R22)).\n\nA genetic basis of CBZ-induced hypersensitivity reactions has previously been investigated in primarily adult patients. In these studies, strong associations of two genetic variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01, with CBZ hypersensitivity were identified. Patients carrying HLA-B*15:02 were shown to be at strongly increased risk of CBZ-induced SJS/TEN ([23](#R23)–[25](#R25)). This discovery resulted in drug label changes for CBZ, and a recent prospective study demonstrated the clinical potential of this pharmacogenetic marker to reduce the occurrence of CBZ-induced SJS/TEN ([26](#R26)). However, HLA-B*15:02 is observed primarily in certain Asian populations and only very rarely in patients outside of Asia ([27](#R27), [28](#R28)). Correspondingly, a higher incidence of CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in countries where HLA-B*15:02 is common has been suggested ([29](#R29)). More recently, HLA-A*31:01 was reported to be associated with various CBZ-induced hypersensitivity reactions, including HSS, SJS/TEN and skin-specific maculopapular exanthems (MPE) in European ([30](#R30)) and Asian ([24](#R24), [31](#R31), [32](#R32)) patients.\n\nHLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 have been clearly established as risk factors for CBZ hypersensitivity in adult patients from Asia and Europe. However, even though some of the studies on HLA-B*15:02 included pediatric patients ([26](#R26), [33](#R33)), to our knowledge, these genetic associations have not been replicated in an entirely pediatric patient cohort. As children often metabolize drugs differently than adults ([34](#R34)), dedicated pediatric pharmacogenomic studies are of value to confirm these associations ([35](#R35)), even though no pediatric-specific effects so far have been reported for HLA-dependent adverse drug reactions. Furthermore, no studies have investigated these genetic risk variants in North American patients with diverse and admixed ancestries. In particular, the more recently reported association of HLA-A*31:01 requires further replication both in patients of European decent, and in patients with non-European or non-Asian ancestries. This study aimed to address these gaps by investigating HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01, two important pharmacogenetic markers with consistent evidence from adult-based studies, in Canadian children with diverse ancestries.\n\n## Results\n\n### Patient Characteristics\n\nA total of 42 children experiencing CBZ-induced hypersensitivity reactions (CBZ cases) and 91 pediatric CBZ-tolerant control patients (CBZ controls) were genotyped. CBZ cases included nine children with SJS/TEN, six patients with HSS, 26 children with MPE, and one patient with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) ([Table 1](#T1)). Median age at the start of CBZ treatment was higher in CBZ cases compared to CBZ controls (P=0.006, [Table 1](#T1)), whereas no differences were observed for mean age during treatment and age at the end of treatment or follow up. With a total daily dose of 750 mg, the median CBZ dose was higher in CBZ controls compared to CBZ cases (P <0.001; [Table 1](#T1)). A larger proportion of CBZ cases were of non-European origin (60% vs 38%; P=0.03; [Table 1](#T1)). All patients received CBZ for the treatment of a seizure disorder.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n|   | CBZ Cases (n = 42) | CBZ Controls (n = 91) | P-valuea | OXC cases (n = 5) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age, years |  |  |  |  |\n| Therapy start, median (range) | 9.9 (0.64–16.9) | 7.4 (0.62–18.7) | 0.006 | 6.6 (3.4–15.3) |\n| Therapy mean, median (range) |   | 9.6 (0.92–21.2) | 0.52 |   |\n| Therapy end, median (range) |   | 10.8 (1.22–23.8) | 0.21 |   |\n| Sex, n (%) |   |   | 0.85 |   |\n| female | 19 (45) | 43 (47) |   | 4 (80) |\n| male | 23 (55) | 48 (53) |   | 1 (20) |\n| CBZ duration, days | n = 38b | n = 88b | <0.001 |   |\n| median (range) | 14 (4–55) | 728 (58–6801) |   | 14 (10–22) |\n| CBZ dose, mg/day | n = 35b | n = 88b | <0.001 |   |\n| median (range) | 400 (80–1000) | 750 (100–2000) |   | 600 (525–900) |\n| Ancestry, n (%)c |   |   | 0.03 |   |\n| Europe | 17 (40) | 56 (62) |   | 3 (60) |\n| Asia | 6 (14) | 6 (7) |   | - |\n| Africa | 1 (2) | 1 (1) |   | - |\n| Aboriginald | 2 (5) | 3 (3) |   | - |\n| Latin America/Caribbean | 4 (10) | 1 (1) |   | - |\n| mixed | 10 (24) | 14 (15) |   | - |\n| unknown | 2 (5) | 10 (11) |   | 2 (40) |\n| Hypersensitivity reaction |  |  |  |  |\n| HSS | 6 | - |   | - |\n| SJS/TEN | 9 | - |   | 2 |\n| MPE | 26 | - |   | 3 |\n| AGEP | 1 | - |   | - |\n| Time to onset of reaction, days | n = 37b |   |   |   |\n| median (range) | 13 (1–48) | - |   | 13 (10–22) |\n| HSS | 16.5 (10–48) | - |   | - |\n| SJS/TEN | 14 (10–24) | - |   | 16 (10–22) |\n| MPEe | 11 (1–28) | - |   | 13 (11–14) |\n| AGEP | 45 | - |   | - |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Patient characteristics.\n\nMedian time to onset of hypersensitivity reactions in CBZ cases was 13 days (range: 1–48 days; [Table 1](#T1)). In all but one patient, CBZ was the only possible causative drug with the appropriate temporal relationship between therapy initiation and onset of symptoms. One patient was taking CBZ and phenytoin, but developed similar symptoms upon re-challenge with CBZ only. Of the nine children with CBZ-SJS/TEN, eight were classified as SJS, and one as SJS/TEN overlap. Four of the children with CBZ-SJS/TEN were of European origin, two were of Southeast Asian origin, and one patient each reported First Nations, Sri Lankan, and Caribbean ancestry, respectively. All SJS/TEN patients had involvement of skin and oral mucosa, with eight patients also experiencing conjunctivitis. Genital mucosa was affected in two patients. Fever was frequent in children with CBZ-SJS/TEN (7 of 9 patients). Elevation of liver enzymes was observed in two CBZ-SJS/TEN patients. All patients with CBZ-HSS experienced a body-wide skin eruption, fever, and elevation of liver enzymes. Eosinophilia was observed in two patients with CBZ-HSS, with one patient also experiencing lymphadenopathy. In one patient with CBZ-SJS, serology suggested an acute *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* infection. However, widespread skin lesions were observed in this patient, which are less common in *Mycoplasma*-induced compared to drug-induced reactions ([36](#R36)). In the other patients, no clear infectious etiology, which could have contributed to the clinical manifestation and severity of hypersensitivity reactions, was identified, even though full screens for infections or virus reactivation were not routinely performed. The presence of mucous membrane erosions in all children with CBZ-SJS allowed for the exclusion of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome as a possible differential diagnosis in these patients ([14](#R14), [37](#R37)).\n\nOf the five patients with OXC-induced hypersensitivity reactions, included for an exploratory analysis of potential genetic associations with this structurally similar drug, two were classified as SJS, and three as MPE. In all hypersensitivity cases, symptoms resolved after the suspected causative drug (CBZ or OXC, respectively) was discontinued.\n\n### Genotyping results\n\nOverall, 20 (15%) children treated with CBZ carried the T allele of rs1061235, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) previously shown to be in complete linkage disequilibrium with HLA-A*31:01 in Europeans ([30](#R30)). However, only 12 (9%) of these patients also carried HLA-A*31:01 as determined by direct sequence-based typing. Of the remaining patients, five carried HLA-A*33:03, and three HLA-A*33:01 ([Supplementary Table 1](#SD1)). HLA-A*31:01 was not observed in any of the children not carrying rs1061235T.\n\nOnly four carriers of HLA-B*15:02 were observed. This was expected, given the low frequency of this variant in non-Asian populations, and the small number of patients with Asian origin in our study (9% of all patients). Genotyping for HLA-B*15:02 failed for four CBZ-tolerant controls due to low DNA quality.\n\n### HSS and MPE\n\nThree of six patients (50%) with CBZ-HSS carried HLA-A*31:01, whereas only three (3.3%) of the 91 CBZ-tolerant controls carried the allele, resulting in a very strong association with CBZ-HSS (OR: 26.4; P=0.0025; [Table 2](#T2)). A significant association was also observed with CBZ-induced MPE, with six of 26 (23.1%) CBZ-MPE cases carrying HLA-A*31:01 (OR: 8.6; P=0.0037; [Table 2](#T2)). HLA-A*31:01 was thus very strongly associated with CBZ-HSS or MPE in a combined analysis of the two reactions (OR: 11.2; P=2.6×10^−4^; [Table 2](#T2)), with nine (28.1%) of the cases carrying HLA-A*31:01.\n\n### Table 2.\n\n|   | Total N | HLA-A*31:01 |  |  | rs1061235T |  |  | HLA-B*15:02 |  |  | Combinedd |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| N positive | OR (95% CI) | P-valuea | N positive | OR (95% CI) | P-valuea | N positive | OR (95% CI) | P-valuea | OR (95% CI) | P-valuea |  |  |\n| CBZ-HSS | 6 | 3 (50) | 26.36 (2.53–307.89) | 0.0025 | 4 (66.7) | 25.97 (3.07–340.87) | 8.2×10−4 | - | 4.44 (0.16–120.08)b | 1.000 | 19.05 (1.95–197.65) | 0.0048 |\n| CBZ-MPE | 26 | 6 (23.1) | 8.57 (1.67–57.50) | 0.0037 | 9 (34.6) | 7.32 (2.03–28.65) | 7.4×10−4 | - | 1.09 (0.04–27.51)b | 1.000 | 6.09 (1.31–32.25) | 0.0095 |\n| CBZ-SJS/TEN | 9 | - | 1.33 (0.06–27.76)b | 1.000 | - | 0.69 (0.04–13.27)b | 1.000 | 3 (33.3) | 38.65 (2.68–2239.5) | 0.0022 | 9.87 (1.18–75.50) | 0.017 |\n| CBZ-AGEP | 1 | - | - | - | 1 (100) | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| All CBZ cases | 42 | 9 (21.4) | 7.85 (1.82–47.80) | 0.0016 | 14 (33.3) | 6.96 (2.25–24.32) | 1.5×10−4 | 3 (7.1) | 6.51 (0.50–350.5) | 0.101 | 8.14 (2.25–37.34) | 2.6×10−4 |\n| HSS/MPE | 32 | 9 (28.1) | 11.18 (2.53–69.27) | 2.6×10−4 | 13 (40.6) | 9.45 (2.91–34.50) | 2.6×10−5 | - | 0.86 (0.03–21.66)b | 1.000 | 7.94 (2.00–38.55) | 8.9×10−5 |\n| CBZ-tolerant | 91/87c | 3 (3.3) | - | - | 6 (6.6) | - | - | 1 (1.1) | - | - | - | - |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Association of HLA-A*31:01, proxy SNP rs1061235 and HLA-B*15:02 with CBZ hypersensitivity.\n\nA highly significant association with CBZ-HSS and MPE was also observed for the HLA-A*31:01 proxy SNP rs1061235 with 14 (33%) CBZ hypersensitivity cases and only six (6.6%) control patients carrying the T allele (combined OR: 9.45; P=2.6×10^−5^; [Table 2](#T2)). Interestingly, rs1061235 was also overrepresented in hypersensitivity cases after excluding HLA-A*31:01-positive children (OR: 5.83; P=0.033; [Supplementary Table 1](#SD1)), resulting in very similar effect sizes of the associations with HSS and MPE for HLA-A*31:01 and rs1061235.\n\nNone of the patients with CBZ-HSS or MPE carried HLA-B*15:02 ([Table 2](#T2)). Therefore, in agreement with previous studies ([24](#R24), [31](#R31)), no significant association of this risk variant with CBZ-HSS or MPE was observed.\n\n### SJS/TEN\n\nIn contrast to the strong associations with HSS and MPE, no HLA-A*31:01 or rs1061235T carriers were detected among the nine patients with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN, and no significant association with CBZ-SJS/TEN was observed (OR: 1.33; P=1.00; [Table 2](#T2)).\n\nOn the other hand, three of the nine patients with CBZ-SJS/TEN were carriers of HLA-B*15:02, resulting in a significant association of HLA-B*15:02 with CBZ-SJS/TEN (OR: 38.6; P=0.002; [Table 2](#T2)). All three HLA-B*15:02-positive patients with CBZ-SJS/TEN were of Asian origin and included the patient with concurrent *Mycoplasma* infection. In this patient, even though *Mycoplasma* infection can also be associated with oral and ocular inflammation and blistering ([36](#R36)), the genetic result was thus consistent with a CBZ-induced reaction.\n\n### AGEP\n\nInterestingly, the single patient with CBZ-induced AGEP tested positive for the proxy SNP rs1061235, but did not carry HLA-A*31:01 ([Supplementary Table 1](#SD1)). Rs1061235T has also been reported in one adult patient with CBZ-AGEP of European descent ([30](#R30)). Whereas direct typing of HLA-A*31:01 was not performed in this patient, a perfect concordance between rs1061235 and HLA-A*31:01 was reported for other European patients in this study, suggesting that the patient also carried HLA-A*31:01. Therefore, our finding may be in disagreement with the previously suggested association of HLA-A*31:01 with AGEP.\n\n### Combined analyses\n\nWhen considering all CBZ hypersensitivity reactions combined, a highly significant association of HLA-A*31:01 was observed (OR: 7.85; P=0.0016; [Table 2](#T2)), even though the effect size was reduced compared to an analysis only including HSS and MPE cases. On the other hand, HLA-B*15:02 was not significantly overrepresented in the CBZ cases overall. In a combined analysis of both risk variants, a strong association was observed with all CBZ-induced hypersensitivity reactions (OR: 8.14; P=2.6×10^−4^; [Table 2](#T2)). Overall, 12 of 42 (28.6%) CBZ cases carried HLA-A*31:01 or HLA-B*15:02, whereas only four (4.6%) CBZ-tolerant patients were positive for either risk variant. Using an estimated incidence of CBZ-induced hypersensitivity reactions (pre-test probability) of 5–10%, the positive post-test probability of a combined genetic test for both risk variants, based on the positive likelihood ratio of 6.21 observed here, was estimated as 25–41%, with a negative post-test probability of 3.8–7.7%.\n\n### HLA-A*31:01 in European patients\n\nGiven the differences in origin between CBZ cases and controls, we performed a subgroup analysis for HLA-A*31:01 in patients with three or more grandparents of European origin. Twenty CBZ cases and 65 controls were included in this analysis. The frequency of HLA-A*31:01 in European CBZ-tolerant children (3.1%; [Table 3](#T3)) was similar to the frequency reported previously in a European study (3.9%). Similar results were observed for the association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ hypersensitivity as for the full cohort, with 20% of CBZ cases carrying HLA-A*31:01 (OR: 7.62; P=0.025; [Table 3](#T3)). As in the full cohort, a stronger association was observed when only considering patients with CBZ-HSS or MPE (OR: 10.05; P=0.013; [Table 3](#T3)).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n|   | Total N | N positive | OR (95% CI) | P-valuea |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CBZ-HSS | 2 | 1 (50.0) | 25.92 (0.27–2437.8) | 0.088 |\n| CBZ-MPE | 14 | 3 (21.4) | 8.23 (0.84–109.23) | 0.037 |\n| CBZ-SJS/TEN | 4 | - | 2.82 (0.12–68.10)b | 1.000 |\n| CBZ-AGEP | - | - | - | - |\n| All CBZ cases | 20 | 4 (20.0) | 7.62 (0.99–91.40) | 0.025 |\n| HSS/MPE | 16 | 4 (25.0) | 10.05 (1.28–122.88) | 0.013 |\n| CBZ-tolerant | 65 | 2 (3.1) | - | - |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Subgroup analysis of HLA-A*31:01 in European patients only.\n\n### OXC hypersensitivity cases\n\nIn the five children with OXC-induced hypersensitivity, one of the two patients with OXC-SJS was positive for rs1061235T, but not HLA-A*31:01. None of the three children with OXC-MPE carried HLA-A*31:01 or rs1061235T. Even though the number of cases is too small to draw any conclusions, we thus did not observe any evidence indicating a strong association of HLA-A*31:01 with OXC hypersensitivity. Similarly, no carriers of HLA-B*15:02 were observed among the patients with OXC hypersensitivity. However, this was not unexpected, as none of the patients with OXC hypersensitivity reported Asian ancestry.\n\n### Origin of risk variant carriers\n\nAll four HLA-B*15:02-positive children reported Asian countries of origin. Eleven of the sixteen grandparents of these children were of Chinese origin, and one grandparent originated from the Philippines, both populations where HLA-B*15:02 is common ([38](#R38)). Interestingly, one HLA-B*15:02-positive child with CBZ-SJS/TEN was of Sri Lankan origin, where, to our knowledge, no HLA-B*15:02-positive cases have been reported so far.\n\nIn contrast to HLA-B*15:02, children carrying HLA-A*31:01 or rs1061235T had a variety of origins ([Figure 1](#F1)). Due to the high proportion of European ancestry in the overall cohort, European origin was also common in HLA-A*31:01 carriers. However, significant proportions of patients also had Aboriginal and Latin American origins ([Figure 1A](#F1)). Interestingly, a majority of patients with West or South Asian origin who carried rs1061235T did not carry HLA-A*31:01, suggesting that rs1061235 alone is not an optimal proxy SNP in some populations.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f240/3839910/f3472d9d3330/nihms3420f1.jpg)\n\nOrigin of HLA-A*31:01 risk variant and proxy SNP rs1061235T carriers.

Here, we replicated important associations of two genetic risk factors, HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01, in pediatric patients. Overall, our findings were in agreement with previous studies, suggesting similar genetic associations in children and adults and an increased risk of CBZ hypersensitivity in children carrying these risk variants. As the first study in ethnically diverse North American patients, we replicated the association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ hypersensitivity and demonstrated the relevance of this risk variant across a broader range of ancestries, as well as provided further replication in European patients.\n\nEven though the number of HSS cases included in our study was small, our observation of a stronger association of HLA-A*31:01 with HSS compared to MPE is in agreement with most previous findings ([30](#R30), [31](#R31)), again suggesting a similar association in children and adults. Overall, the frequency of HLA-A*31:01 in children with CBZ-HSS or MPE was similar to the frequencies reported previously in European patients ([30](#R30)), but lower than frequencies reported in Japanese and Korean populations ([31](#R31), [32](#R32)). This is in agreement with the large proportion of patients in our study reporting European origins, and suggests that also the overall frequency of HLA-A*31:01 in our multiethnic patient cohort was similar. Of importance, we showed that the proxy SNP rs1061235 is not an optimal surrogate marker for HLA-A*31:01 in ancestrally diverse populations. Our observation of rs1061235T being overrepresented among CBZ hypersensitivity cases also in patients not carrying HLA-A*31:01 suggests that further investigation of this proxy SNP, particularly in multiethnic populations, may still be of interest.\n\nWe did not detect an association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ-SJS/TEN, which is in contrast to two previous studies that reported a stronger association with SJS/TEN compared to CBZ-HSS or MPE with odds ratios of 26 and 34 ([30](#R30), [31](#R31)). The number of SJS cases in our study was limited, particularly when taking into consideration that three SJS cases carried HLA-B*15:02, reducing our power to detect an association. However, besides the two studies reporting a strong association ([30](#R30), [31](#R31)), evidence from other adult-based studies regarding the association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ-SJS/TEN is also conflicting. For example, no significant association was observed in another study in Japanese patients ([39](#R39)) and in a Korean study ([32](#R32)). Random sampling effects due to the small numbers of cases and differences in the clinical characterization of SJS/TEN may partly explain these discrepant findings. Nevertheless, assuming an effect size as reported previously (OR ≥26), the probability of, by chance, observing no risk variant carriers among six CBZ-SJS cases in our study was <2.3%. Random sampling error alone is thus unlikely to explain the absence of HLA-A*31:01 among SJS cases. Therefore, whereas no conclusions can be drawn regarding an association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ-SJS/TEN or lack thereof, our findings combined with others suggest that the association of HLA-A*31:01 may not be as strong as initially reported. Further studies investigating HLA-A*31:01 in the context of CBZ-SJS/TEN are thus needed in both pediatric and adult patients.\n\nIn contrast, the observed association of HLA-B*15:02 with CBZ-SJS/TEN is in full agreement with previous findings ([23](#R23)–[25](#R25), [40](#R40)–[42](#R42)) with HLA-B*15:02 being observed in all children with CBZ-SJS/TEN who reported Asian origins. Of particular interest, we report here for the first time an HLA-B*15:02-positive patient with Sri Lankan origin, suggesting the presence and clinical relevance of HLA-B*15:02 in Sri Lanka. Data on the population frequency of HLA-B*15:02 in Sri Lanka is, to our knowledge, not available. However, HLA-B*15:02 has been associated with CBZ-SJS/TEN in patients from India ([43](#R43)). Due to the geographical proximity, the presence of HLA-B*15:02 in patients from Sri Lanka would not be surprising.\n\nSimilarly, we report here for the first time the presence of HLA-A*31:01 in CBZ hypersensitivity cases with Aboriginal and Latin American origin, demonstrating the relevance of this risk variant across a broader range of ancestries. This finding is in agreement with high population frequencies reported for HLA-A*31:01 in many ethnic groups ([38](#R38)). In particular, high HLA-A*31:01 population frequencies (up to 48% carrier frequency) have been reported in Aboriginal Americans. This is in agreement with our observation that Aboriginal Canadian ancestry was common (19%) in HLA-A*31:01 carriers and suggests a high relevance of HLA-A*31:01 for Aboriginal American patients receiving CBZ.\n\nA larger proportion of patients were of European origin in the CBZ-tolerant group compared to the hypersensitivity cases in our study. As the frequencies of HLA alleles differ between populations, this difference in ancestry between cases and controls could potentially affect our results. In particular, the overrepresentation of patients carrying rs1061235T but not HLA-A*31:01 may be partly attributed to the different frequencies of non-European origins between cases and controls. Many of these patients carried HLA-A*33:03 and were of Asian origin, where HLA-A*33:03 is more common compared to European populations. On the other hand, given the consistency of our findings between the overall cohort and a subgroup analysis in European patients, and the overall agreement of our findings with other studies, any effect of ancestral differences between cases and controls is unlikely to affect the overall conclusions of this study regarding the associations of HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 with CBZ hypersensitivity. Nevertheless, future studies in pediatric patients should be conducted that include CBZ-tolerant children with non-European ancestries.\n\nFinally, even though HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 are important risk factors in the context of CBZ hypersensitivity, not all patients carrying these variants developed a hypersensitivity reaction. In fact, based on the combined evaluation of both risk markers in our population of ancestrally-diverse Canadian children and an estimated frequency of hypersensitivity reactions of 5%, approximately 3 out of 4 of patients carrying a risk variant are expected to tolerate CBZ. Similarly, HLA-A*31:01 or HLA-B*15:02 were not present in all CBZ hypersensitivity cases. The two risk variants therefore appear to be neither sufficient nor necessary to trigger CBZ hypersensitivity. Further studies are needed to identify additional risk factors in order to improve the prediction of hypersensitivity reactions and avoid unnecessary withholding of CBZ from patients in whom it would have been safe. Promising findings have recently been reported in the context of HLA-B*15:02, where certain T-cell receptor clonotypes were found to be expressed in combination with HLA-B*15:02 to elicit an *in vitro* reaction to CBZ ([44](#R44)).\n\nNevertheless, in spite of the relatively low positive predictive power of these genetic tests, the severity of SJS/TEN and HSS combined with the availability of equally effective alternative therapies for many indications justifies genetic testing for HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 to identify children and adults at increased risk for CBZ hypersensitivity. Even though HLA-B*15:02 is rare in some populations, carriers of the risk variant can still occur ([32](#R32)). Furthermore, the frequency of HLA-B*15:02 is unknown for many populations. As the safest approach, we therefore suggest predictive testing for both variants in all patients, irrespective of their ancestry. In particular, a combined test for both markers is likely to be beneficial in ethnically diverse populations, where the full genetic ancestry of patients may not be known and many patients are of mixed origins.\n\nIn conclusion, these findings demonstrate that HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 are predictive of CBZ-induced hypersensitivity reactions in children and that HLA-A*31:01 is a relevant marker in patients of various ancestries. Even though further investigation is needed to elucidate the magnitude of the association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ-SJS/TEN and AGEP, these pharmacogenetic markers have great potential to reduce the occurrence of severe and life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions and improve the safety of CBZ therapy.\n\n## Patients and Methods\n\n### Patients\n\nAll study participants were recruited through the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety (CPNDS) ([45](#R45)) in pediatric hospitals across Canada. Blood or saliva samples were obtained for genetic analyses. Clinical data was obtained through detailed review of medical records, performed blind to genotype data by a clinical pharmacologist, a dermatologist and an adverse drug reaction surveillance clinician. Self-reported ancestry was obtained from all patients as country of origin of patients, parents and grandparents. No genetic analyses were conducted to confirm reported ancestries; however, a previous investigation of 524 CPNDS samples revealed a good concordance between self-reported and genetic ancestry ([46](#R46)).\n\nSJS/TEN (including SJS, SJS/TEN overlap, and TEN), HSS, and AGEP were defined according to the criteria suggested by The Phenotype Standardization Project for immune-mediated drug-induced skin injury ([18](#R18)). Patients with SJS/TEN or HSS were further characterized using an in-house scoring tool (available from the authors by request) to assess the likelihood of diagnosis, differentiating between possible, probable, and highly likely cases, based on the available clinical data (e.g. presented symptoms, temporal relationship between drug and reaction onset, likelihood of other etiologies), and incorporating elements from the ALDEN algorithm ([47](#R47)) to assess drug causality. All SJS/TEN and HSS cases included in this study were classified as probable or highly likely.\n\nMPE were defined as any cutaneous reaction occurring within the first eight weeks of CBZ treatment and resulting in CBZ discontinuation, with or without fever but without other systemic symptoms. One patient developed a rash, fever and conjunctival injection after initiation of CBZ and phenytoin, and developed a rash with fever upon rechallenge with CBZ only. This patient was classified as MPE. One patient developed mucosal lesions and bilateral conjunctivitis, but no skin lesions. As not all diagnostic criteria for SJS were fulfilled, the patient was afebrile and no clear infectious etiology was identified, this patient was classified as possible erythema multiforme and grouped with MPE for analyses.\n\nCBZ-tolerant controls were defined as patients taking CBZ for at least eight weeks without any adverse reaction. Patients tolerating CBZ who experienced a cutaneous adverse reaction to other drugs (n = 13) were excluded from the control population.\n\nFive patients with OXC-induced hypersensitivity reactions were genotyped for an exploratory evaluation of indications for an association of the same HLA variants with hypersensitivity reactions to this structurally similar drug. Characterization of OXC-induced hypersensitivity reactions was performed using the same criteria as for CBZ. No OXC-tolerant controls were included as the number of available control patients (n = 13) was too small to perform any meaningful statistical analyses.\n\nWritten informed consent or assent was obtained from all study participants or their parents or legal guardians. This study was approved by the ethics committees of all participating universities and hospitals.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp or the QIAsymphony DNA purification systems (Qiagen, Toronto, Canada). Genotyping was performed using the PG1502 DNA Detection Kit (Pharmigene, Inc., Taipei, Taiwan) for direct typing of HLA-B*15:02. For HLA-A*31:01 a Custom Taqman SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for rs1061235, a proxy SNP showing an absolute correlation (R^2^ = 1) with HLA-A*31:01 in Europeans ([48](#R48)). Genotyping was performed according to standard protocols on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). In addition, direct sequence-based typing for HLA-A*31:01 was also performed as described previously ([49](#R49)), using primers I1-240 and I3-249 for allele-specific amplification of exons 2 and 3 for HLA-A*31 and *33.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical software R ([50](#R50)). Associations of genetic variants with CBZ hypersensitivity were assessed using Fisher’s exact test and a dominant genetic model. For evaluation of clinical variables in patients with and without CBZ hypersensitivity, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for continuous variables, and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Two-sided *P*-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n### What is the current knowledge on this topic?\n\n### What is the current knowledge on this topic?\n\n### What is the current knowledge on this topic?\n\n### What is the current knowledge on this topic?\n\nUp to 10% of patients initiating carbamazepine therapy experience hypersensitivity reactions including life-threatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome and hypersensitivity syndrome. HLA-B*15:02 is a well-known genetic marker for carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome in Asian patients. HLA-A*31:01 was recently identified as a risk factor for carbamazepine hypersensitivity in adult patients from Europe and Asia.\n\n### What question this study addressed\n\nThe association of HLA-A*31:01 with carbamazepine hypersensitivity required further replication, particularly in children and patients of other ancestries. To address this gap, we investigated HLA-A*31:01 together with HLA-B*15:02 in ancestrally-diverse children with carbamazepine hypersensitivity from across Canada.\n\n### What this study adds to our knowledge\n\nHLA-A*31:01 was associated with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and maculopapular exanthems also in children with diverse ancestries. Only HLA-B*15:02, but not HLA-A*31:01, was associated with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\n\n### How this might change clinical pharmacology and therapeutics\n\nThese results demonstrate the clinical relevance of predictive HLA genotyping in children to identify patients at risk for carbamazepine hypersensitivity, and the importance of HLA-A*31:01 as a risk factor across ancestries.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe especially thank all study children and their families for their participation in the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety (CPNDS) and this specific study.

The HLA-B★1502 allele has been shown to be strongly correlated with carbamazepine-induced Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS–TEN) in the Han Chinese and other Asian populations but not in European populations.\n\n**METHODS:** \nWe performed a genomewide association study of samples obtained from 22 subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, 43 subjects with carbamazepine-induced maculopapular exanthema, and 3987 control subjects, all of European descent. We tested for an association between disease and HLA alleles through proxy single-nucleotide polymorphisms and imputation, confirming associations by high-resolution sequence-based HLA typing. We replicated the associations in samples from 145 subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n**RESULTS:** \nThe HLA-A★3101 allele, which has a prevalence of 2 to 5% in Northern European populations, was significantly associated with the hypersensitivity syndrome (P = 3.5×10−8). An independent genomewide association study of samples from subjects with maculopapular exanthema also showed an association with the HLA-A★3101 allele (P = 1.1×10−6). Follow-up genotyping confirmed the variant as a risk factor for the hypersensitivity syndrome (odds ratio, 12.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 121.03), maculopapular exanthema (odds ratio, 8.33; 95% CI, 3.59 to 19.36), and SJS–TEN (odds ratio, 25.93; 95% CI, 4.93 to 116.18).\n\n**CONCLUSIONS:** \nThe presence of the HLA-A★3101 allele was associated with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions among subjects of Northern European ancestry. The presence of the allele increased the risk from 5.0% to 26.0%, whereas its absence reduced the risk from 5.0% to 3.8%.

An independent genomewide association study of samples from subjects with maculopapular exanthema also showed an association with the HLA-A★3101 allele (P = 1.1×10^−6^). Follow-up genotyping confirmed the variant as a risk factor for the hypersensitivity syndrome (odds ratio, 12.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 121.03), maculopapular exanthema (odds ratio, 8.33; 95% CI, 3.59 to 19.36), and SJS–TEN (odds ratio, 25.93; 95% CI, 4.93 to 116.18).\n\n### CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe presence of the HLA-A★3101 allele was associated with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions among subjects of Northern European ancestry. The presence of the allele increased the risk from 5.0% to 26.0%, whereas its absence reduced the risk from 5.0% to 3.8%. (Funded by the U.K. Department of Health and others.)\n\n## METHODS\n\n### CASE SUBJECTS\n\n#### Recruitment\n\nWe recruited case subjects at centers collaborating with the University of Liverpool and Walton Centre for Neurology (both hereinafter referred to as “the Liverpool collaborators”) or at centers affiliated with the EPIGEN consortium (for details, see the [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1), available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). All case subjects and control subjects were of European ancestry as determined by either self-report or genetic-marker analysis.^13^ Many of these subjects have been described previously in the context of hypersensitivity reactions.^9,13,16^\n\n#### Hypersensitivity Syndrome\n\nThe group with the hypersensitivity syndrome consisted of 26 subjects: 23 who were recruited through the Liverpool collaborators and 3 who were recruited through the EPIGEN consortium. The hypersensitivity syndrome was defined as the presence of rash or liver involvement within 3 months after the initiation of carbamazepine treatment, accompanied by a minimum of two of the following manifestations: a prolonged recovery phase, despite withdrawal of the drug; fever; involvement of other internal organs (liver, kidney, lung, central nervous system, heart, muscle, thyroid, or lymphoid system); or the presence of hematologic abnormalities, such as eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytosis.^17^ We considered the DRESS syndrome to be the same as the hypersensitivity syndrome.\n\n#### Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis\n\nWe recruited one subject with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), who had a typical pustular reaction with high fever,^18^ from a collaborating clinic in Switzerland. We then analyzed the data from this subject together with data from the subjects with the hypersensitivity syndrome.\n\n#### Maculopapular Exanthema\n\nThe group with maculopapular exanthema consisted of 106 subjects: 57 who were recruited through the Liverpool collaborators and 49 who were recruited through the EPIGEN consortium. Maculopapular exanthema was defined as rash without systemic symptoms that required the discontinuation of carbamazepine within 3 months after the initiation of drug therapy.\n\n#### SJS–TEN\n\nThe SJS–TEN group consisted of 12 subjects: 8 who were recruited through the Liverpool collaborators and 4 who were recruited through the EPIGEN consortium. The diagnostic criteria suggested by the RegiSCAR Project (a research network for severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions)^11,19^ were used for this group (see the [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)).\n\n### CONTROL SUBJECTS\n\n#### Population Controls\n\nGenotype data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) ([www.wtccc.org.uk](http://www.wtccc.org.uk)) were used as a population control group. The Liverpool collaborators used data from a genome-wide association study of samples from 2691 subjects in the U.K. National Blood Services Collection. EPIGEN used samples from a homogeneous subgroup of 1296 subjects in the 1958 British Birth Cohort that were selected by principal component analysis. We did not screen either set of population controls for carbamazepine-related adverse drug reactions. (For details about our access to these data, see the [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1).)\n\n#### Clinical Controls\n\nThe clinical control group consisted of 257 subjects with epilepsy who had been taking carbamazepine for at least 3 months with no clinical or biochemical signs of hypersensitivity. Of these subjects, 44 were recruited by the Liverpool collaborators and 213 were recruited from clinics affiliated with EPIGEN.\n\n### GENOMEWIDE GENOTYPING\n\nGenomewide analysis of samples that were initially available from the 22 Liverpool subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome was performed with the use of the Illumina Infinium 1.2M chip at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Samples from 43 case subjects and 200 control subjects from the EPIGEN consortium were genotyped with the use of the Illumina 610K Quad platform at the Duke University Center for Human Genome Variation. (Details regarding quality controls and principal-components analysis are provided in the [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1).)\n\n### IMPUTATION OF HLA ALLELES\n\nWe based the imputation of classic HLA alleles in samples from the 22 Liverpool subjects with the hypersensitivity syndrome and control subjects from the U.K. National Blood Service on a dense reference panel of SNP data and four-digit HLA types in 2767 unrelated subjects of European descent, according to a method described recently.^20^ We imputed classic HLA alleles in the samples from the EPIGEN consortium, using MACH 1.0 on the Web site of the Center for Statistical Genetics ([www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH](http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH)).^21^ The 1458 subjects in the HLA-typed 1958 British Birth Cohort constituted the reference population. (See the [Supplementary Appendix](#SD1) for further details.) We used different approaches to impute the HLA alleles in the Liverpool and EPIGEN subjects, because the two studies were originally independent.\n\n### HLA-A HIGH-RESOLUTION GENOTYPING\n\nTo confirm the accuracy of imputation, high-resolution, sequence-based HLA-A typing of samples from 22 subjects with the hypersensitivity syndrome and from a subgroup of 44 clinical control subjects (i.e., subjects who did not have adverse reactions to carbamazepine) was performed by Histogenetics. We determined the HLA-A alleles in samples from 49 subjects with maculopapular exanthema and a subgroup of 213 clinical control subjects from the EPIGEN consortium, using sequence-specific polymerase-chain-reaction assay primers (details available on request). Direct genotyping showed 100% concordance with the imputed alleles.\n\n### HLA-A*3101 PROXY SNP GENOTYPING\n\nGenotyping of the rs1061235 SNP in samples from all Liverpool subjects (including case subjects with maculopapular exanthema, the hypersensitivity syndrome, or SJS–TEN and clinical control subjects) was performed by KBioscience. This allele has previously been shown to be in complete linkage disequilibrium (r^2^ = 1) with the HLA-A★3101 allele in populations of European descent.^22^\n\n### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with the use of PLINK (version 1.05),^23^ RevMan (version 5) ([http://ims.cochrane.org/revman](http://ims.cochrane.org/revman)), and Haploview^24^ software packages. For the genomewide association studies, both the Liverpool collaborators and the EPIGEN consortium used logistic regression with an additive model of inheritance. They adjusted for population stratification by including significant principal components as covariates in the logistic-regression model and used a P value of less than 5.0×10^−8^ to indicate genomewide significance. Pooled analysis of the different groups of subjects was performed to estimate odds ratios and confidence intervals from summary data with the use of a random-effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was tested by calculating I^2^ and Tau.^2^ The z-score directionality or estimated risk was checked for consistency with observed data.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n### ASSOCIATION WITH THE HYPERSENSITIVITY SYNDROME\n\nWe first conducted an association analysis involving 1.2M SNPs in samples from the 22 Liver-pool subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and from 2691 healthy controls from the U.K. National Blood Services Collection. (The full set of results can be obtained from the European Genotype Archive, access number EGAS00000000037.) We identified a strong signal in the MHC region on chromosome 6, with several SNPs around HLA-A reaching genome-wide significance (P = 3.5×10^−8^) ([Fig. 1A and 1B](#F1)). This variant was seen in 40.0% of case subjects but in only 4.9% of control subjects. The top hit (rs1061235) had previously been shown to be a proxy for the HLA-A★3101 allele in persons of European descent.^22^ Therefore, we focused on this locus as a predictor of response through high-resolution, sequence-based HLA-A typing, which confirmed the absolute correlation (r^2^ = 1) between rs1061235 and HLA-A★3101 that had been observed previously.^22^ No other classic HLA-A alleles reached nominal significance ([Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)).\n\n### Figure 1. Results of a Genomewide Association Study of Samples from Case Subjects with Carbamazepine-Induced Hypersensitivity Syndrome and Control Subjects.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/446c/3113609/2854fe4ae560/nihms287234f1.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3113609_nihms287234f1.jpg)\n\nPanel A shows a Manhattan plot for logistic regression with a strong signal in the HLA-A region on chromosome 6. Each dot represents a P value for the comparison of 22 case subjects with the hypersensitivity syndrome and 2691 healthy control subjects from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Panel B shows P values for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA-A region. There is a strong association between carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and the HLA-A*3101 allele, with identification of the allele in 40.0% of case subjects and only 4.9% of control subjects. The x axis shows the SNP position on chromosome 6 (National Center for Biotechnology Information build 36). The left y axis shows the negative log10 of P values for the comparison between case subjects and control subjects, as calculated with logistic regression. The right y axis shows the recombination rate on chromosome 6 between 29 and 31 Mb. The diamonds show the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the samples.\n\nDuring the course of this study, samples from 4 additional subjects with the hypersensitivity syndrome and from 1 additional subject with AGEP became available from the Liverpool and EPIGEN centers. Of these 5 subjects, 2 (including the single subject with AGEP) tested positive for HLA-A★3101. A comparison of all 27 subjects with the 257 control subjects without adverse drug reactions produced an odds ratio of 12.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 121.03; P = 0.03) ([Fig. 2](#F2)).\n\n### Figure 2.

The sample obtained from one patient with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) was analyzed with the samples for the group of case subjects with the hypersensitivity syndrome. Since there were no observations of the HLA-A*3101 allele in the three case subjects with the hypersensitivity syndrome in the EPIGEN cohort, 0.5 was added to each value in a two-by-two contingency table to estimate an odds ratio. One patient with the Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS–TEN) was of mixed European and Thai ancestry. Study weighting (indicated by different sizes of squares) refers to the proportion of subjects who were recruited from each study cohort. Diamonds indicate pooled odds ratios. The horizontal lines indicate 95% confidence intervals. The abbreviation df denotes degrees of freedom, and I2 is the percentage of total variation that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance.\n\n### ASSOCIATION WITH MACULOPAPULAR EXANTHEMA\n\nEPIGEN investigators performed a genomewide association study of samples from 43 subjects with maculopapular exanthema and 1296 healthy control subjects from the 1958 British Birth Cohort. (The full set of results can be obtained from dbGAP, access number EGAS00000000036.) HLA-A★3101 was the most strongly associated allele (P = 1.11×10^−6^) and was observed in 27% of case subjects and 4% of control subjects, although the effect was not significant genomewide ([Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Appendix](#SD1)). However, we had access to another 63 case subjects with maculopapular exanthema and 257 control subjects without adverse drug reactions. Our combined analysis of all 106 subjects with maculopapular exanthema and the 257 clinical control subjects showed a significant allelic association with HLA-A★3101 (P=8.0×10^−7^), generating an odds ratio of 8.33 (95% CI, 3.59 to 19.36) ([Fig. 2](#F2)). Although the analyses of samples from subjects with maculopapular exanthema and those with the hypersensitivity syndrome were carried out in the Netherlands and Liverpool, respectively, the effect size of HLA-A★3101 on risk was consistent across the EPIGEN and U.K. groups.\n\n### ASSOCIATION WITH SJS–TEN\n\nOn the basis of our hypothesis that the HLA-A★3101 allele is associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS–TEN, we genotyped HLA-A★3101 in a group of 12 subjects with SJS–TEN who were recruited from both the Liverpool and EPIGEN-affiliated centers. Of these 12 subjects, 5 (42%) carried the allele, as compared with 10 (4%) of the 257 clinical control subjects (odds ratio, 25.93; 95% CI, 4.93 to 116.18; P = 8.0×10^−5^) ([Fig. 2](#F2)).\n\nA pooled analysis of all 145 subjects with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity and 257 control subjects without adverse drug reactions showed a strong association between hypersensitivity and the HLA-A★3101 allele (odds ratio, 9.12; 95% CI, 4.03 to 20.65; P = 1.0×10^−7^). On the basis of this pooled collection, we calculated that the presence of HLA-A★3101 had a sensitivity of 26% and a specificity of 96% as a predictor of carbamazepine-associated hypersensitivity. Given that carbamazepine hypersensitivity has a prevalence of 5% (1:20), application of the test criteria from our pooled analysis would increase the post-test probability to 26% (approximately 1:4) on the basis of the positive likelihood ratio of 6.74 (95% CI, 3.51 to 13.00). Since the negative likelihood ratio was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.84), a negative HLA-A★3101 test would reduce the probability of hypersensitivity from 5.0% to 3.8% (1:26 ratio).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nWe found that a variation in the presence of the HLA-A★3101 allele is an important predictor of the full spectrum of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions in persons of European descent. Such reactions range from the relatively mild but nevertheless troublesome maculopapular exanthema to more severe reactions, such as the hypersensitivity syndrome and SJS–TEN. Although the presence of the HLA-A★3101 allele is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of hypersensitivity to carbamazepine, it is associated with a significantly increased risk.\n\nOur data add to growing evidence of the role of different HLA alleles in predisposing patients to immune-mediated adverse reactions, such as drug-induced hypersensitivity^4,25–27^ and liver injury.^3,28^ The most prominent example thus far is the strong predictive value of the HLA-B★5701 allele for hypersensitivity to the drug abacavir, used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection.^25,26,29^ FDA guidelines now recommend HLA-B★5701 testing in advance of abacavir prescription. Testing results in a reduction in the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity^27,30^ and is cost-effective.^29,31^\n\nOur study now provides strong evidence suggesting that HLA-A★3101 is a predictor of carbamazepine hypersensitivity in Europeans. First, despite the small number of subjects who were included in the analysis, this signal had genome-wide significance. Second, the signal was observed across independent groups of case subjects with different phenotypes of carbamazepine hypersensitivity, with the use of independent sets of control subjects. Third, HLA-A★3101 has previously been shown to be associated with multiple carbamazepine-hypersensitivity phenotypes, including SJS–TEN in Japanese subjects^15,32^ and with carbamazepine-induced maculopapular exanthema in subjects of Han Chinese ancestry.^14^ The one subject in our study who had AGEP, a reaction characterized by sterile pustules, neutrophilic inflammation, and high levels of interleukin-8 in skin,^33^ also was found to carry the HLA-A★3101 allele. The prevalence of this allele is 2 to 5% in Northern European populations, 2% in Han Chinese populations, and 9% in Japanese populations.^32,34,35^ The finding that HLA-A★3101 is associated with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity in populations of different ancestries parallels the finding of HLA-B★5701-associated abacavir hypersensitivity.^30,36^\n\nHLA-B★1502, a predictor of carbamazepine hypersensitivity reactions in Asian populations, seems to be phenotype-specific in that it predicts the development of SJS–TEN but not the development of the hypersensitivity syndrome or maculopapular exanthema.^14^ This finding has led to the suggestion that the pathogenesis of carbamazepine-induced SJS–TEN is distinct from that of the hypersensitivity syndrome. This hypothesis is based on the fact that class I alleles are usually associated with specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell reactions, which is consistent with the known pathologic features of SJS–TEN.^37^ However, our data suggest that the class I allele HLA-A★3101 may be important for an increased range of phenotypes, including maculopapular exanthema and the hypersensitivity syndrome, at least in European populations. Persons with carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome have been shown to have several types of drug-specific T cells in peripheral blood, including CD4+, CD8+, and CD4−CD8+ cells.^38^ Although there is no obvious relationship between HLA-A★3101 and HLA-B★1502, reports have indicated a possible overlap in peptide-binding specificity.^39^ Given the degree of linkage disequilibrium across the extended MHC region, we cannot be certain that either HLA-B★1502 or HLA-A★3101 is causal.\n\nWe used samples from healthy volunteers in the WTCCC as control subjects for both genomewide association studies. Given that the hypersensitivity syndrome occurs in 1 in 5000 to 1 in 10,000 persons, it is unlikely that more than one or two population control subjects would be at risk for hypersensitivity with exposure to carbamazepine. The larger WTCCC collections therefore afforded increased power over that provided by comparison of case subjects with the clinical control subjects. Nevertheless, in analyses involving the 257 clinical control subjects, the association with HLA-A★3101 remained strong for both the hypersensitivity syndrome (odds ratio, 12.41; 95% CI, 1.27 to 121.03) and SJS (odds ratio, 25.93; 95% CI, 4.93 to 116.18), although the effect size was smaller with maculopapular exanthema (odds ratio, 8.33; 95% CI, 3.59 to 19.36).\n\nAdditional studies in populations of European descent and other ancestry are required to further characterize this association. The International Serious Adverse Event Consortium is coordinating a global effort to recruit subjects with drug-induced severe adverse events ([www.saeconsortium.org](http://www.saeconsortium.org)). Efforts such as this will facilitate the analysis of larger groups of subjects, which may well uncover other genetic variants associated with a smaller effect size or population-specific variants. Additional work is also required to determine whether the effect of the HLA-A★3101 allele is specific to carbamazepine or whether it also applies to other drugs. A prospective study that is based on the results we present here would facilitate the routine clinical use of HLA-A★3101 testing in carbamazepine treatment. In this issue of the *Journal*, a report describes how prospective HLA-B★1502 typing can prevent carbamazepine-induced SJS–TEN in Han Chinese populations.^5^\n\nWe propose that HLA-A★3101 is clinically relevant as a marker to predict hypersensitivity reactions. On the assumption that the prevalence of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity is 5.0%, the presence of the HLA-A★3101 allele increases the risk of hypersensitivity to 26.0%, whereas its absence reduces the risk to 3.8%. Among Japanese patients, the estimated reduction is from 2.9% to 1.1%. The sensitivity and specificity values estimated here for Europeans (26% and 96%) and by others for Japanese populations (61% and 88%)^32^ vary. Among a number of possible reasons for these differences are differences in study size, in the frequency of HLA-A★3101 (and potential interacting variation), and in the effect size of the allele across the two populations. Nonetheless, these numbers are similar to those underlying the test criteria calculated for the presence of the HLA-B★5701 allele and abacavir hypersensitivity (sensitivity, 45.5%; specificity, 97.6%; and a risk reduction from 7.8% to 2.7%).\n\nOn the basis of our data, we have calculated that 83 patients would need to be screened to prevent one case of carbamazepine hypersensitivity; the number in the Japanese population is 56. However, it is important to note that this calculation is based on a conservative estimate of the prevalence of carbamazepine hypersensitivity (5%). The prevalence of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity that was determined in the context of the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs (SANAD) trial (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN38354748) (also involving subjects of European descent) was 10%.^40^ On the basis of this prevalence, the number of persons who would need to be screened to prevent one instance of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity is 39. We therefore suggest that consideration be given to adding the association with HLA-A★3101 to the drug label for carbamazepine.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nSupported by grants to the Liverpool collaborators from the Department of Health, the National Health Service Chair of Pharmacogenetics, the Medical Research Council Centre for Drug Safety Science, the Wolfson Foundation, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and the National Institute for Health Research (to Dr. Pirmohamed); by grants to the EPIGEN consortium from the Medical Research Council (G0400126), the Well-come Trust (084730), University College London Hospitals Charity, Clinical Research and Development Committee (F136), and the National Institute for Health Research (08–08-SCC); by an award (2009/001) from Brainwave–the Irish Epilepsy Association; by the Medical Research Charities Group of Ireland, the Health Research Board, the National Society for Epilepsy, Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique, and Fonds Erasme pour la Recherche Médicale, Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium); by a Translational Research Scholars award from the Health Research Board of Ireland (to Mr. McCormack); by the Department of Health National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centres; and by a contract from the National Cancer Institute (HHS-N261200800001E) and the Intramural Research Program at the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health.\n\nWe thank the subjects and the physicians who recruited them; U.K. Eudragene co-coordinator Paul McKeigue; Drs.

In addition to common genetic variations, large-scale sequencing studies have uncovered multiple rare genetic variants predicted to cause functional alterations in genes encoding proteins implicated in drug metabolism, transport and response. To understand the functional importance of rare genetic variants in DPYD, a pharmacogene whose alterations can cause severe toxicity in patients exposed to fluoropyrimidine-based regimens, massively parallel sequencing of the exonic regions and flanking splice junctions of the DPYD gene was performed in a series of nearly 3000 patients categorized according to pre-emptive DPD enzyme activity using the dihydrouracil/uracil ([UH2]/[U]) plasma ratio as a surrogate marker of DPD activity. Our results underscore the importance of integrating next-generation sequencing-based pharmacogenomic interpretation into clinical decision making to minimize fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy toxicity without altering treatment efficacy.\n\nSubject terms: Predictive markers, Genetic testing\n\n## Introduction\n\nAn increasing number of clinically relevant association between drug response and genomic variation has been reported over the past years, resulting in evidence-based pharmacogenetic guidelines [[1](#CR1), [2](#CR2)]. For instance, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge base PharmGKB ([https://www.pharmgkb.org](https://www.pharmgkb.org)) has collected and curated information for more than 740 drugs and, to date, contains 189 clinical guidelines and 868 drug label annotations approved by various pharmaceutical regulatory organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Nevertheless, although many patients would benefit from pharmacogenetics-based prescription policy [[3](#CR3)], only limited applications are observed in clinical practice, especially in primary care [[4](#CR4)–[7](#CR7)]. Indeed, genetic testing is in most cases performed retrospectively when adverse side effects arise or when a drug lacks efficacy. Main barriers to the implementation of pharmacogenetics into routine clinical practice are the lack of awareness and education of physicians and pharmacists, solid scientific evidence of pharmacogenomic biomarkers, harmonized and implementable pharmacogenomic guidelines and in some instances, the absence of a dedicated infra-structure to integrate pharmacogenetics testing into the workflow of health care providers [[6](#CR6), [8](#CR8)]. Seminal studies have notably shown the importance of common genetic variants affecting phase I or phase II enzymes in the resistance to various pharmacological agents or the occurrence of life-threatening side effects [[9](#CR9)]. Prominent examples include the association between common defective TPMT alleles and the risk of hematotoxicity following 6-mercaptopurine exposure [[10](#CR10)] or the impact of frequent specific CYP2C19 polymorphisms on clopidogrel efficacy [[11](#CR11)]. Nevertheless, these common genetic variants, while important, only account for little of the inherited individual variation in drug response and a substantial fraction of the genetically encoded variability in drug pharmacokinetics remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, recent large-scale studies have unveiled that more than 90% of the genetic variability in genes associated with drug metabolism and disposition is assigned to rare genetic variants, but the functional impact of such rare pharmacogenetic variants on drug response remains poorly documented.\n\nFluoropyrimidine-based treatment regimens are the standard therapy for many distinct types of advanced solid tumors including breast, colorectal as well as head and neck cancers [[12](#CR12)]. Nevertheless, up to 30% of patients will experience serious adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea, stomatitis, mucositis, myelosuppression or neurotoxicity, which can be lethal in 0.5–1% of cases [[12](#CR12), [13](#CR13)]. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the initial and rate limiting enzyme involved in the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), is responsible for the elimination of 80–85% of the administered dose. Plasma concentrations of uracil ([U]), the endogenous substrate for DPD, or its product dihydrouracil (UH_2_) are routinely used as a surrogate marker for systemic DPD activity [[14](#CR14)]. Indeed, pretreatment [U] and [UH_2_]/[U] ratio are highly correlated with systemic DPD activity and many studies have shown a relationship between fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity and a DPD phenotype characterized by high [U] or low [UH_2_]/[U] ratio [[14](#CR14), [15](#CR15)]. However, the equipment required as well as the recommended pre-analytical conditions for the measurement of [U] and [UH_2_] are not widely available in many clinical laboratories [[16](#CR16), [17](#CR17)]. Therefore, implementation of alternative approaches such as *DPYD*-based pharmacogenetic assays are convenient complementary methods to accurately predict DPD activity [[16](#CR16)]. Indeed, according to PharmGKB, more than 20 loss-of-function *DPYD* variants have been reported to alter DPD enzymatic activity, and consequently patients harboring such variants are exposed to an increased risk of severe toxicity when receiving standard dose of fluoropyrimidine. For this reason, international guidelines now recommend pre-emptive *DPYD* genotyping for several clinically relevant defective variants: i.e., c.1905+1G>A (*DPYD*2A*), c.1679T>G (*DPYD*13*), c.2846A>T, and Haplotype B3 (c.1236G>A or c.1129–5923C>G) as well as genotype-guided prescribing recommendations [[17](#CR17), [18](#CR18)].\n\nIn this study, using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), we comprehensively assessed the relationship between *DPYD* genotype and DPD phenotype in a series of 2 972 patients and identified new rare clinically relevant variants associated with DPD deficiency. Our results also show that rare *DPYD* genetic variants account for a significative part of the interindividual variability of DPD activity. Therefore, comprehensive NGS-based genotyping instead of candidate SNP interrogation should be considered for the guidance of personalized fluropyrimidine therapy.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Studied cohort\n\nAll patients included in this study were eligible for an uracil analog-based chemotherapy (Supplementary Table S[1](#MOESM1)). Only those for which both *DPYD* genotype and DPD phenotype were available were included. The protocol has been certified to be in accordance with French laws by the Institutional Review Board of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille (France). Genotyping analysis and DPD phenotyping were performed as described in our local regular protocol to identify DPD-deficient patients at increased risk of severe fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity. However, information regarding fluoropyrimidine toxicity was not available. All patients provided their written informed consent for genetic analysis and to publish this paper in accordance with institutional guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki and Istanbul. The DNA collection was registered by the Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche (Paris, France) under the number: DC-2008–642.\n\n### DPD phenotyping\n\nPretreatment Plasma Uracil [U] and dihydrouracil [UH_2_] were quantified using a Waters TQD UPLC^®^-MS/MS System (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization interface according to the method described by Coudore et al. [[19](#CR19)]. Data acquisition and processing were performed using MassLynx v.4.0 software. DPD activity was categorized as normal, partial or complete deficiency based on previous reports using the [UH_2_]/[U] ratio [[20](#CR20)–[26](#CR26)]. Indeed, although no consensual cut-off values for the [UH_2_]/[U] ratio has been established yet, a [UH_2_]/[U] ratio cut-off below or equal to 10 was chosen for DPD deficiency as it has been previously demonstrated as a good predictor of fluoropyrimidine toxicity [[15](#CR15), [27](#CR27)]. Therefore, partial DPD deficiency was defined as [UH_2_]/[U] ≤ 10 whereas complete DPD deficiency was defined as [UH_2_]/[U] ≤ 1. Alternatively, DPD activity can also be estimated by measuring [U] and a cut-off value over or equal to 16 µg/mL is used to define partial deficiency and over 150 µg/mL for complete deficiency [[15](#CR15)].\n\n### DPYD genotyping\n\nAll patients gave their written informed consent for genetic testing. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using Chemagic Star (Chemagen, Baesweiler, Germany) and then quantified using the NanoDrop® spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic sequence of the *DPYD* gene was retrieved from the NCBI website and the Reference Sequence [NG_008807.2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NG_008807.2) was subsequently used. Primers were designed to include all exonic regions and at least 30 bp of each flanking intron using Fluidigm D3™ assay design web-based tool. A total of 64 unique primer pairs were created and are listed in Supplementary Table S[2](#MOESM2). Custom-designed primer pairs to target *DPYD* exonic regions and exon–intron boundaries were designed and optimized for the Fluidigm Access Array (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA, USA). Amplification of genomic DNA was performed in up to 10-plex PCR reaction wells, followed by addition of barcode indexes and sequencing adaptors by further PCR according to manufacturer’s instructions. Pooled amplicons were harvested and diluted to prepare unidirectional libraries for 150 base-pair (bp) paired-end sequencing on Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Illumina NGS reads were trimmed for base Phred quality control (mean quality in a 30 bp sliding window >20 and 3′ base quality ≥6) and aligned with Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (v0.6.1-r112-master) on hg19 human genome reference sequence. Variant-calling was achieved using MiSeq Reporter v2.6, GATK v3.7 or GATK v4.1.4.0 (Genome Analysis Toolkit) [[28](#CR28)] without downsampling or removal of PCR duplicates; variants with quality/depth < 5 or depth < 30 were filtered. All very rare (MAF ≤ 0.1%) and novel variants identified by NGS analysis were validated by Sanger sequencing (Table S[2](#MOESM2)). The functional consequences of each variant were estimated by in silico analysis, using bioinformatic prediction tools such as SIFT, PolyPhen-2 or CADD and on the basis of the ACMG classification.\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nSample size was chosen empirically based on our previous experiences in the calculation of experimental variability; no statistical method was used to predetermine sample size and no samples or data points were excluded from the reported analyses. Data are described as the medians ± standard deviations, or *n* (%). Since [U] and [UH_2_]/[U] values were not normally distributed, non-parametric tests were performed. Allelic frequencies and genotype distribution were estimated by gene counting and tested for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. For the comparison of proportions and to evaluate the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, we used the chi-square test. As in most cases, a low number of individuals carries the alternate allele homozygote, the influence of the genotypes on DPD activity was assessed by clustering genotypes into a dominant inheritance model. Then, genotypes were compared using non parametric Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests. The level of significance was set at *p* < 0.05. All analyses were two-sided. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism® 5.0 (GraphPad) and JMP (SAS) software.\n\n## Results\n\n### Inter-individual variability of pretherapeutic DPD enzyme activity\n\nThis retrospective study included 2972 subjects. Mean patient age was 65 ± 11 years, and the sex ratio (M/F) was 1.2 (Supplementary Table S[1](#MOESM1)). Using a cut-off value below or equal to 10 for the [UH_2_]/[U] ratio, 580 patients (19.7%) were categorized with partial DPD deficiency, whereas no patient exhibited complete DPD deficiency. Mean age did not significantly differ between the partial DPD deficiency group and the normal DPD group (Supplementary Table S[1](#MOESM1)). Overall, [U] and [UH_2_]/[U] values identified 628 patients (21.1%) with DPD deficiency, but these parameters were in agreement in only 114 (18.2%) patients (Table [1](#Tab1)). Indeed, 466 (15.7%) patients presented [UH_2_]/[U] ≤ 10 and [U] < 16 ng/mL, and 48 (1.6%) presented [UH_2_]/[U] > 10 and [U] ≥ 16 ng/mL (Table [1](#Tab1)). The [UH_2_]/[U] level below which [U] values were all ≥ 16 ng/mL was 4.6, and the [U] level above which [UH_2_]/[U] values were all ≤ 10 was 49 ng/mL, suggesting that a better agreement between [UH_2_]/[U] and [U] values to identify DPD deficiency would require the use of more restrictive thresholds. Based on these results, the current cut-off values for [U] and [UH_2_]/[U] do not identify DPD deficiency in an equivalent manner, and a [UH_2_]/[U] ratio ≤ 10 yields a higher proportion of individuals classified with partial DPD deficiency than [U] levels > 16 ng/mL.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Phenotype | [U] < 16 ng/mL | [U] ≥ 16 ng/mL |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [UH2]/[U] > 10 | 2344 | 48 |\n| [UH2]/[U] ≤ 10 | 466 | 114 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Number of patients according to the uracil plasma concentration ([U]) and the dihydrouracil/uracil ([UH2]/[U]) plasma ratio.\n\n### Genetic variants identified in DPYD\n\nThe group of patients with partial DPD deficiency represented a total of 580 patients, including 134 wild-type patients (*DPYD*1/*1*) and 446 patients harboring at least one genetic variant (208 patients carried one genetic variant and 238 patients more than one). Overall, genetic variants identified in patients with partial DPD deficiency represent a total of 809 variants. The remaining 2392 patients exhibiting normal DPD activity include 623 wild-type patients (*DPYD*1/*1*) and 1769 mutated patients in which a total of 3183 genetic variants were identified (831 carrying a single genetic variant and 938 carrying more than one). The mean coverage (read depth) of the identified genetic variants was 1130 (range: 33–4995) for the group of patients with DPD partial deficiency and 1131 (range: 33–7612) for group of patients whose phenotype was unaltered. 30 distinct genetic variants were identified in the group of patients exhibiting partial DPD deficiency (29 single nucleotide polymorphisms and one indel). Among these genetic variants, 23% (7/30) were common (MAF ≥ 1%) and 77% (23/30) were considered as rare /very rare or novel (MAF < 1%), and among these, 58% (13/23) were classified as deleterious according to variant effect prediction algorithms (Table [2](#Tab2)). In addition, the majority of variants were missense (77%; 23/30), one was non-sense, one was categorized as indel and two were located in canonical splice sites. Among the remaining variants, 10% (3/30) were synonymous. In the group of patients exhibiting a normal DPD phenotype, 58 unique genetic variants were identified including 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms and two indel. 12% (7/58) were common whereas 88% (51/58) were considered as rare/very rare or novel (MAF < 1%) including 35% (18/51) classified as deleterious by functional prediction algorithms. In addition, the majority of variants were missense (55%, 32/58), two were non sense and six were located in canonical splice sites. Among the remaining variants, 29% (17/58) were synonymous and 2% (1/58) were located in the UTR (Untranslated Regions). All rare genetic variants were heterozygous. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for each common and rare variant and allelic frequencies are reported in Supplementary Table S[3](#MOESM3). As the French law of information and freedom prohibits to collect information on ethnicity, it was thus impossible to provide data frequency according to patient ancestry. We thus made the assumption that our population was mainly European (Supplementary Table S[3](#MOESM3)).\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| Position (GRCh37) | Ref | Alt | Statut | Number of patients |  | Allele Freq. | HGVS |  | dbSNP ID | Allele | Transcript consequences | SIFT (score) | PolyPhen (score) | CADD(score) | ClinVar ID | GnomAD (Eur.

DPYD by next generation sequencing.\n\n### Association between the most clinically relevant DPYD defective variants and DPD deficiency\n\nDose adjustment based on pretreatment screening for the most clinically relevant *DPYD* defective variants, i.e. c.1679T>G (*DPYD*13*, rs55886062), c.1905+1G>A (*DPYD*2A*, rs3918290) and c.2846A>T (p.Asp949Val or rs67376798), has been shown to improve the safety of chemotherapy regimens based on fluorouracil [[29](#CR29)]. Accordingly, international recommendations now provide indications for drug-related genetic tests and *DPYD* genotype-guided dosing in routine clinical practice [[17](#CR17), [18](#CR18)]. As expected, our data showed a significant association between each of these genetic variants and low DPD activity (Fig. [1](#Fig1)).\n\n### Fig. 1. Association between the most clinically relevant DPYD defective rare variants and DPD deficiency.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/06c3/10786722/c9a040ee3cf3/41397_2023_322_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nBox plot showing DPD pretreatment activity assessed by the dihydrouracil/uracil ([UH2]/[U]) plasma ratio according to the patient genotype.

Among the seven genetic variants identified, three variants (c.1236G>A or rs56038477 p.Glu412Glu ; c.496A>G or rs2297595 p.Met166Val; *DPYD*6 *c.2194G>A or rs1801160 p.Val732Ile) were significantly more frequent in the group of patients exhibiting partial DPD deficiency. Consistent with previous reports, the c.1236G>A (rs56038477) which is included in the risk haplotype B3 was significantly associated with low DPD activity [[30](#CR30), [31](#CR31)]. Nevertheless, compared to the most clinically relevant *DPYD* defective variants, the association of these three variants with DPD activity was rather modest (Fig. [2](#Fig2)).\n\n### Fig. 2.

The red dash line indicates the ratio threshold used to categorize patients as having partial DPD deficiency (ratio ≤10) or normal DPD activity (ratio >10). n = number of patients, ns = non-significant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.\n\n### Association between rare, very rare and novel DPYD genetic variants and DPD deficiency\n\nThe list of frequent (MAF ≥ 1%), rare (MAF < 1%) and very rare (MAF ≤ 0.1%) variants identified in the *DPYD* gene in the whole cohort is summarized in Table [2](#Tab2). The number of patients in each group is summarized in Fig. [3A](#Fig3). Variants with a MAF below 1% were found to be enriched in patients exhibiting low DPD activity (9.3% versus 3.2% ; *P* < 0.00001) **(**Fig. [3B](#Fig3)). This remained significant when excluding the rare clinically relevant *DPYD* defective variants (4.5% versus 2.6% ; *P* < 0.03). As many rare variants are likely to have little to no impact on DPD activity, a similar analysis including variants with a MAF below 1% and a putative deleterious impact on *DPYD* function according to CADD score (threshold above 15) was performed after excluding the rare clinically relevant *DPYD* defective variants. Indeed, a CADD score above 15 has been previously shown as a good prediction tool for pharmacogenetic variants [[32](#CR32)]. Not surprisingly, these were more common in the group of patients with low DPD activity (4.2% versus 1.6% ; *P* < 0.001) (Fig. [3C](#Fig3)). Overall, our results indicate that rare *DPYD* genetic variants account for a significative part of the interindividual variability of DPD activity.\n\n### Fig. 3.

Large scale sequencing studies have notably shown that single-nucleotide variants are the most common form of protein-altering “functional variants” identified among genes relevant to the drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, also known as pharmacogenes [[33](#CR33), [34](#CR34)]. Of particular interest, results from these studies have also revealed that rare genetic variants account for a substantial part of the unexplained interindividual differences in drug response, but their exact contribution on drug pharmacokinetics has not been systematically evaluated and remains thus poorly understood [[33](#CR33)–[36](#CR36)]. In this study, we focused on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the metabolic catabolism of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU or its prodrugs, whose complete deficiency is associated with impaired clearance of 5-FU, excessive drug accumulation and severe toxicity.\n\nVarious genotyping and phenotyping approaches have been developed to assess DPD deficiency in order to reduce the incidence of severe toxicity without affecting treatment efficacy by dose tailoring fluoropyrimidine-based therapy. Although various uracil-based methods are routinely used in various countries to predict DPD deficiency, clinical relevance of pretreatment DPD phenotyping by these assays remains controversial [[30](#CR30)]. Indeed, optimal cutoff levels that predict toxicity have not been validated yet and previous studies have shown extensive variability in uracil measurements when different cohorts were compared [[12](#CR12), [18](#CR18), [37](#CR37), [38](#CR38)]. In line with this, de With et al. [[39](#CR39)]. very recently raised important issues against the utility of uracil-based assays in clinical practice given the large inter-center variability observed in measured pretreatment uracil levels. By contrast, the clinical validity of genotype-based approaches has been established in multiple metaanalyses as well as in large prospective studies [[39](#CR39), [40](#CR40)]. Results from these studies have in particular shown that prediction of DPD enzyme activity by molecular genetic testing in routine clinical practice is a reliable method that not only significantly improves patient safety but is also cost‐effective [[41](#CR41)]. Consequently, clinical practice guidelines now recommend pre-emptive *DPYD* genotyping especially in Europe, where these four *DPYD* deficient alleles are relatively common in individuals of Caucasian ancestry [[42](#CR42)]. Nevertheless, even using this strategy, prediction of fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity remains suboptimal to detect all patients at risk of toxicity [[43](#CR43)]. In this context, we aimed to assess whether rare genetic variants significantly contribute to the large interindividual variability of DPD enzyme characterizing a series of about 3 000 patients using new sequencing technologies.\n\nNext Generation Sequencing (NGS) refers to a wide range of technologies enabling rapid and high-throughput sequencing of DNA [[44](#CR44)]. In recent years, NGS has been successfully used to comprehensively interrogate the entire spectrum of genomic variations in pharmacogenes including rare variants [[33](#CR33)]. In line with this, we applied an NGS-based approach to capture rare and common genetic variations located either in the coding sequence of the *DPYD* gene or its flanking intronic regions. Specifically, our results confirmed the strong impact of the three clinically rare variants. Additionally, although a significant association between DPD activity and three common known variants including Haplotype B3 was also shown in our large series of patients, their modest effect on DPD activity raises the question of their clinical relevance. Therefore, we suggest additional studies to clarify their use in prospective *DPYD* genotyping, especially as our study may be biased by several confounding factors. Of particular interest, our results also showed the importance of considering rare *DPYD* genetic variants to predict the risk of 5-FU toxicity. This is in agreement with results from sequencing data established in large distinct populations, which showed that the vast majority of variants among pharmacogenes are rare (MAF < 1%) or very rare (MAF ≤ 0.1%) and non-synonymous, with an estimated 30-40% of functional variability likely attributed to these rare variants [[45](#CR45)]. For example, resequencing of 202 drug target genes in about 14 000 individuals showed that more than 95% of the identified variants had a MAF below 0.5% and that 90% of those were not known [[46](#CR46)]. In light of our results, we suggest that additional studies should be performed to assess the association between rare *DPYD* genetic variants and fluoropyrimidine toxicity. This point is indeed of importance and represents one limitation of our study, as we could only assess the relationship between rare genetic variants and DPD activity.\n\nIn conclusion, our results strongly suggest that integrating rare genetic variants into routine pharmacogenetic testing can significantly improve the prediction of DPD enzyme activity. Therefore, we advocate that pre-emptive screening of DPD deficiency should be based on a more comprehensive genotyping approach, combined with phenotyping strategies, to ensure the safe administration of fluoropyrimidines.\n\n## Supplementary information\n\n## Author contributions\n\nConceptualization, MP, CC and NP; Formal analysis, RL and BH; Investigation, NS and CD; Methodology, RL; Writing – original draft, RL and NP; Writing – review & editing, SF, NB, CVdH, MC, DA and CC.\n\n## Data availability\n\nData and results are available at the Unit of Pharmacogenetics, University Hospital of Lille.\n\n## Competing interests\n\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Supplementary information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41397-023-00322-x.\n\n## Associated Data\n\n*This section collects any data citations, data availability statements, or supplementary materials included in this article.*\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n### Data Availability Statement\n\nData and results are available at the Unit of Pharmacogenetics, University Hospital of Lille.\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n### Data Availability Statement\n\nData and results are available at the Unit of Pharmacogenetics, University Hospital of Lille.\n\n## References\n\n1.

We have previously shown that the presence of HLA-B*5701 strongly predicts abacavir hypersensitivity and have identified a potential susceptibility locus within a 300-kb region between the MEGT1 and C4A6 loci in the central MHC. We now report the results of fine recombinant genetic mapping in an expanded patient population of 248 consecutive, fully ascertained, abacavir-exposed individuals in the Western Australian HIV Cohort Study, in which 18 cases of definite abacavir hypersensitivity (7.3%) and 230 tolerant controls were identified. Haplotype mapping within patients with allelic markers of the 57.1 ancestral haplotype suggests a susceptibility locus within the 14-kb Hsp70 gene cluster. HLA-B*5701 was present in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases compared with 1.7% of controls (odds ratio, 960; P < 0.00001). A haplotypic nonsynonymous polymorphism of Hsp70-Hom (HspA1L, resulting from the substitution of residue M493T in the peptide-binding subunit) was found in combination with HLA-B*5701 in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases and 0.4% of controls (odds ratio, 3,893; P < 0.00001). Individuals with abacavir hypersensitivity demonstrated increased monocyte tumor necrosis factor expression in response to ex vivo abacavir stimulation, which was abrogated with CD8+ T cell depletion. These data indicate that the concurrence of HLA-B*5701 and Hsp70-Hom M493T alleles is necessary for the development of abacavir hypersensitivity, which is likely to be mediated by an HLA-B*5701-restricted immune response to abacavir.\n\nKeywords: ancestral haplotype, microsatellite, human leukocyte antigen, single-nucleotide polymorphism\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n**Subjects.** **Retrospective study.** The first 200 participants of the Western Australian HIV Cohort Study, to whom abacavir was prescribed before December 31, 2001, and who were included in our previous study ([1](#ref1)), were reclassified based on updated diagnostic criteria. Clinical diagnostic criteria included the occurrence of classical symptoms suggestive of multisystem involvement within 6 weeks of exposure. An appropriate temporal relationship between symptom resolution and cessation of abacavir was required by these diagnostic criteria. In cases where the clinical diagnostic criteria were fulfilled but an alternative explanation for these symptoms was present, epicutaneous patch testing and assessment of the specific immunological response to *ex vivo* abacavir stimulation were undertaken to clarify the role of abacavir.\n\n**Prospective study.** Forty-eight individuals exposed to abacavir since the introduction of prospective genetic testing for *HLA-B*5701* and/or *HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DQ3* in December 2001 were classified by a clinician blinded to the results of genetic analysis using the updated diagnostic criteria.\n\n**Patch Test.** Epicutaneous patch testing was undertaken, and reactions ([14](#ref14)) were read after 24 and 48 h of application. A positive result required absence of an allergic response to the control vehicle and demonstration of typical skin changes consisting of erythema and vesicular rash limited to the patch area. Attempts were made to patch test all individuals previously classified as abacavirhypersensitive cases, including those carrying markers of the 57.1 AH (*n* = 14, with 9 consenting to patch testing) as well as those who did not (*n* = 4, with 3 consenting to patch testing). Within the latter group, three individuals who had an alternative explanation for their symptoms (concurrent nevirapine therapy) were tested. The remaining individual who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for abacavir hypersensitivity in the absence of an alternative explanation had relocated and was unavailable for further testing.\n\nWithin the group clinically designated as “abacavir hypersensitivity not excluded” (*n* = 15) in our previous study ([1](#ref1)), three individuals consented to patch testing. Testing also was performed on abacavir-tolerant individuals carrying markers of the 57.1 AH (*n* = 12, with 4 consenting to patch testing), including two who carried the *HLA-B*5701* allele, and on two individuals carrying the full 57.1 AH (*HLA-B*5701, C4A6*, and *HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DQ3*) who had not been exposed to abacavir. Results were negative in all nine individuals.\n\n**Typing of MHC Markers and Assignment of Alleles Specific to the 57.1 AH.** Typing of MHC markers was carried out by using standard genetic assays and sequencing. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes located in the *C4A6*–*MEGT1* region were examined by using the National Center for Biotechnology Information's SNP database ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP)). Primers were designed based on oligonucleotide sequences reported within the database, and primers and conditions used in the assay are available on request. A set of well characterized 10 IHWS Epstein–Barr virus-transformed homozygous B cell lines representing commonly occurring European AHs was used to determine alleles carried on the 57.1 AH. Full-length sequencing across the *Hsp70* gene cluster was performed by using overlapping primer pairs.\n\n**Measurement of the TNF Response to Abacavir.** Intracellular expression of TNF was assessed in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) grown in the presence and absence of abacavir sulfate at 4 μg/ml (Ziagen 300-mg commercial grade tablet dissolved in PBS, pH 7.4) by means of three-color flow cytometry ([15](#ref15)). The PBMCs were stained with CD45-ECD, CD14-FITC, or IgG1-FITC (isotype control) antibodies (all obtained from Immunotech, Marseille, France) and analyzed on a Coulter EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer by using the listmode fcs2 data analysis program (Coulter) ([15](#ref15)).\n\n**CD4 and CD8 Cell Depletion.** TNF levels were measured in supernatants of 1 ml of whole blood cultured in the absence and presence of abacavir (1 μg/ml, Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) for 24 h at 37°C. Whole blood was depleted of either CD4^+^ or CD8^+^ T cells by using the Dynabead kit (Dynal, Oslo).\n\n**Statistical Analyses.** Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by using Haldane's modification, which adds 0.5 to accommodate possible zero counts ([16](#ref16)). Comparisons of demographic and related data in abacavir-hypersensitive (*n* = 18) and abacavir-tolerant (*n* = 230) groups were made by using methods previously described ([1](#ref1)). Positive and negative predictive values were calculated within the retrospective abacavir-exposed cohort (*n* = 200) to exclude potential confounding caused by the active exclusion of abacavir use among those carrying 57.1 AH markers in the prospective cohort. Absolute and relative LD between *HLA-B*5701* and *Hsp70-Hom M493T* was calculated by using the formulas of Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer ([17](#ref17)) and Baur and Danilov ([18](#ref18)). Significance of LD was measured by using Fisher's exact test.\n\n## Results\n\n**Prevalence of Abacavir Hypersensitivity.** In this abacavir-exposed cohort of 248 individuals, 18 cases with abacavir-hypersensitive reactions were identified by applying restrictive diagnostic criteria to identify “definite” cases of hypersensitivity for the purposes of genetic analysis. This group included 16 definite abacavirhypersensitive cases from the previously reported cohort of 200 consecutive abacavir-exposed individuals ([1](#ref1)), providing a prevalence of 8%. Two other cases were identified among 48 individuals treated with abacavir after prospective genetic testing.\n\nIn our previous study ([1](#ref1)), 18 of 200 individuals were clinically classified as abacavir-hypersensitive. Among these, three individuals were receiving concurrent nevirapine therapy, which also may cause hypersensitive reactions. These patients had a negative response to the epicutaneous abacavir skin patch test after 48 h of application and did not develop a cytokine response to *ex vivo* abacavir stimulation (see below). Subsequently, two of these patients have been rechallenged successfully with abacavir without developing abacavir hypersensitivity, whereas the third patient has developed a similar hypersensitive reaction to efavirenz (a drug within the same class as nevirapine). The negative epicutaneous patch test results for these three individuals contrast with the positive results obtained from the nine remaining patients previously classified as abacavir-hypersensitive who underwent testing (see *Materials and Methods* for details), whereas negative results were obtained in all six abacavir-tolerant individuals tested. On these grounds, these individuals did not meet the clinical and immunological diagnostic criteria used in this study. Another individual from this retrospective cohort (case 14) was classified as abacavir-hypersensitive, having been clinically designated as “abacavir hypersensitivity not excluded.” This individual developed typical and severe symptoms that fulfilled the clinical diagnostic criteria within a few days of exposure to abacavir, and no alternative explanation for these symptoms was identified. However, the diagnosis of abacavir hypersensitivity was not made, and the symptoms gradually resolved over a period of days with intensive supportive inpatient care at a peripheral hospital. The individual was therefore likely to have become desensitized by the continued administration of abacavir and had a negative response to epicutaneous patch testing, also in keeping with desensitization to the drug.\n\nIn our previous study ([1](#ref1)), a clinical diagnostic category of “abacavir hypersensitivity not excluded” was applied to 15 individuals who developed any symptoms within 6 weeks of the introduction of abacavir therapy ([1](#ref1)), whereas the remaining, abacavirtolerant group (*n* = 167) was entirely asymptomatic. One case described above was classified here as abacavir-hypersensitive. In the remaining 14 individuals, an alternative cause of symptoms was present in five cases (three were treated concurrently with efavirenz, one with nevirapine, and one with amprenavir). In these individuals, symptoms did not have an appropriate temporal relationship with abacavir therapy and/or recurred on rechallenge with the alternative antiretroviral drug. Minor symptoms described by nine individuals did not fulfill clinical diagnostic criteria. These cases were therefore classified as abacavir-tolerant for the purposes of genetic analysis.\n\nSince our initial study ([1](#ref1)), 48 individuals have been HLA-typed before exposure to abacavir. All patients with *HLA-B*5701* and *HLA-DRB1***0701, HLA-DQ3* alleles were actively excluded from exposure to abacavir-based regimens. Two of 48 patients (4.2%) developed a hypersensitive reaction, whereas the remaining 46 patients remained asymptomatic on abacavir therapy. One individual carried the *HLA-B*5701, C4A6*, and *HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DQ3* alleles and was prescribed abacavir before review of the results of the HLA typing; another individual, who carried the *HLA-B*5701* but not the *C4A6* allele or the *HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DQ3* combination, made an informed choice to undertake abacavir therapy. Hence, the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity among *HLA-B*5701*-negative individuals in this prospective cohort was 0% (95% confidence interval, 0–0.075%).\n\nDemographic data for the entire cohort of 248 individuals is given in [Table 1](#tbl1). Within the abacavir-exposed cohort (*n* = 248), 214 participants were classified as patients of predominantly European or Asian Indian descent, and the rest consisted of 11 patients of African origin, 15 indigenous Australians, and 8 patients of Asian origin.\n\n### Table 1.

With regard to alleles specific to the 57.1 AH, *HLA-B*5701* was present in 17 of 18 (94.4%) cases with abacavir hypersensitivity and 4 of 230 (1.7%) abacavir-tolerant controls [OR = 960, *P* value corrected for the number of alleles examined (*P*_c_) < 0.0001]. *C4A6* was present in 14 of 18 (77.8%) cases and 7 of 230 (3.0%) controls (OR = 111, *P*_c_ < 0.0001), and the haplospecific combination of *HLA-DRB1*0701* and *HLA-DQ3* was present in 14 of 18 (77.8%) cases and 11 of 230 (4.8%) controls (OR = 70, *P*_c_ < 0.0001). Hence, *HLA-B*5701* provided the strongest univariate association with susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity. When these markers were combined, the previously described *HLA-B*5701, C4A6, HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DQ3* haplotype ([1](#ref1)) was present in 14 of 18 (77.8%) cases and in none of the 230 controls (OR = 1,485, *P*_c_ < 0.0001).\n\n### Table 2. MHC alleles observed within the abacavir-hypersensitive and -tolerant controls.\n\n| MHC marker | Hypersensitive, n (%) | Tolerant, n (%) | OR | Positive predictive value, % | Negative predictive value, % |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| HLA-B*5701 | 17 (94.4) | 4 (1.7) | 960.0 | 78.9 | 99.4 |\n| C4A6 | 14 (77.8) | 7 (3.0) | 111.5 | 72.2 | 98.3 |\n| HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DQ3 | 14 (77.8) | 11 (4.8) | 69.7 | 65.0 | 98.3 |\n| Hsp70-Hom M493T | 17 (94.4) | 51 (22.2) | 59.7 | 25.4 | 99.3 |\n| HLA-B*5701, C4A6 | 14 (77.8) | 0 | 1,485.0 | 100.0 | 98.4 |\n| HLA-B*5701, HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DQ3 | 14 (77.8) | 0 | 1,485.0 | 100.0 | 98.4 |\n| HLA-B*5701 Hsp70-Hom M493T | 17 (94.4) | 1 (0.43) | 3,893.0 | 93.8 | 99.5 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: The HLA-B*5701, HLA-DRB1*0701, HLA-DQ3, and C4A6 typing was performed as described in our previous study (1). The Hsp70-Hom M493T SNPs were typed by using a combination of restriction fragment-length polymorphism and sequence-specific primer polymorphism assays. For all MHC markers, corrected P values are <0.00001. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated within the retrospective abacavir-exposed cohort (n = 200), to exclude potential confounding caused by the active exclusion of abacavir use among those carrying 57.1 AH markers in the prospective cohort.\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/245a/384715/fbd795321f09/zpq0090440320001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=384715_zpq0090440320001.jpg)\n\nIncreased frequency of markers of the 57.1 AH among abacavirhypersensitive individuals. As shown from left to right, MHC markers including HLA-B*5701, C4A6, and HLA-DR7, HLA-DQ3 were compared in the healthy controls of the Western Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (n = 3,212), HIV-positive cohort (n = 381), abacavir-exposed cohort (n = 248), abacavirhypersensitive group (n = 18), and abacavir-tolerant group (n = 230).\n\n**Mapping of Putative Susceptibility Loci Within the MHC.** To map the putative susceptibility locus/loci within the MHC, polymorphic markers typically found on the 57.1 AH were required. Such markers within the central MHC region between *C4A6* and *MEGT1* were identified by comparing examples of the 57.1 AH with a subset of well characterized Epstein–Barr virus-transformed cell lines representative of common European AHs ([Fig. 2](#fig2) and Table 3, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The sequenced 8.1, 7.1, and 18.2 AHs (The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute MHC Haplotype Project, [www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/Chr6/MHC/index.shtml](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/HGP/Chr6/MHC/index.shtml)) also were compared. The carriage of these markers was examined in the cases (*n* = 18) and controls (*n* = 12) recombinant for the 57.1 AH to determine the presence of these markers of the 57.1 AH and to map the extent of the haplotype within the patients ([Fig. 2](#fig2)). Three additional 57.1 AH recombinant abacavir-tolerant controls subsequently identified in the prospective cohort were included in [Table 2](#tbl2) but not in the fine mapping study ([Fig. 2](#fig2)). With reference to abacavir-hypersensitive individuals, the centromeric boundary of the putative susceptibility region was marked by the three SNPs present on the 57.1 AH and absent in three *HLA-B*5701*-positive, *C4A6*-negative recombinant cases (cases 15–17) suggestive of decay of the 57.1 AH centromeric of *Hsp70.2* in *HLA-B*5701*-negative individuals ([Fig. 2](#fig2)). One of these cases (case 16) carried the *HLA-B*5701* allele and the *Hsp70* region of the 57.1 AH but lacked the region from *snRNP* to *MEGT1*, expressing non-57.1 AH alleles at one SNP and two microsatellite loci in this region. The translated sequences of *Hsp70.1* and *Hsp70.2* were similar in abacavir-hypersensitive individuals (cases 15–17) and controls with recombinant 57.1 AHs (cases 19–22) and were therefore excluded as candidate susceptibility loci.\n\n### Fig. 2.\n\n![Fig. 2.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/245a/384715/2bb2b6b6f101/zpq0090440320002.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=384715_zpq0090440320002.jpg)\n\nRecombinant mapping identifies the Hsp70 subgenomic region in combination with HLA-B*5701 as the most parsimonious susceptibility region to abacavir hypersensitivity. The region carrying the putative susceptibility loci has been mapped to the MHC class III region on chromosome 6p21.3 (1). Typing of genetic markers within the C4A6–MEGT1 interval present on the 57.1 AH was carried out on abacavir-hypersensitive cases (n = 18) and abacavir-tolerant controls (n = 12) recombinant for the 57.1 AH. For each individual, shading indicates presence of the marker carried by the 57.1 AH.\n\nThe presence of previously reported nonsynonymous substitutions within genes in the region telomeric of the *Hsp70* cluster between *MEGT1* and *snRNP* was examined in the 57.1 AH homozygous cell line and compared with the MHC sequence of the 8.1, 7.1, and 18.2 AH sequences submitted to GenBank (Table 3). We did not identify unique nonsynonymous substitutions in this relatively nonpolymorphic interval. Hence, mapping of recombinant 57.1 AHs among abacavir-hypersensitive and -tolerant cases identified a candidate susceptibility region including the *Hsp70* gene cluster that narrowed the putative susceptibility region to the *Hsp70-Hom* locus. The only nucleotide substitution in the *Hsp70-Hom* gene identified in most of the abacavir-hypersensitive cases (94.4%) involvedaTtoC transition, which results in a change from methionine to threonine at amino acid residue 493 [hereafter referred to as *M493T* but also known as the *Hsp70-Hom 2437CT* allele ([19](#ref19)) or *rs2227956CT* ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?locusId=3305](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?locusId=3305)]. The *Hsp70-Hom M493T* allele was assessed in all 248 patients of the cohort by using an allele-specific sequence-specific primer and/or the standard *Nco*I restriction fragment-length polymorphism assays. We observed that the *Hsp70-Hom M493T* allele, carried on the 57.1 AH, was detected in 94.4% of the hypersensitive group compared with 22.2% of tolerant controls (17 of 18 individuals vs. 51 of 230 individuals, OR = 59.7, *P*_c_ < 0.00001). However, in combination with *HLA-B*5701*, the *Hsp70-Hom M493T* allele was strongly associated with abacavir hypersensitivity (17 of 18 individuals vs. 1 of 230 individuals, OR = 3,893, *P*_c_ < 0.00001) ([Table 2](#tbl2)). Consistent with a role for both of these genetic markers in determining susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity, inclusion of the *Hsp70-Hom M493T*, in addition to the *HLA-B*5701*, allele provided significantly improved discrimination between abacavir-hypersensitive cases and -tolerant controls compared with the *HLA-B*5701* allele alone (*P* = 0.003, Fisher's exact test).\n\n**Expression of Inflammatory Cytokine TNF in Abacavir-Hypersensitive Individuals.** Cytokine response was examined by measuring intracellular TNF levels in cultures of abacavir- or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated PBMCs from abacavir-hypersensitive, -tolerant, and unexposed HIV-positive patients. The proportion of monocytes accumulating TNF was measured in a rapid (4 h) abacavir-stimulated *ex vivo*-cultured PBMC assay. The proportion of TNF-positive cells was higher in patients with abacavir hypersensitivity (*n* = 8) than in abacavir-tolerant controls (*n* = 9) with a median 13.4-fold increase [interquartile range (IQR) = 13.0] compared with a median 8.9-fold decrease in proportion of TNF-positive cells in tolerant controls (IQR = 24.1, *P* = 0.008, Mann–Whitney test) (data not shown). The three individuals classified as abacavir-tolerant on the basis of a negative epicutaneous patch test and an alternative explanation for their symptoms also had no increase in TNF-positive cells in response to abacavir stimulation.\n\n**Phenotype of T Cells Expressing TNF After Abacavir Stimulation.** Further phenotypic characterization of the T cell response to abacavir was carried out on whole blood cultures of two patients who were selected for analysis because they both carried the predictive *HLA-B*5701* and *Hsp70-Hom M493T* alleles yet were divergent in their clinical responses to abacavir. Definite abacavir hypersensitivity occurred in case 17 within 1 week of drug exposure, whereas case 21 tolerated this drug without any clinical symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity. Involvement of CD4^+^ and CD8^+^ T cells in the secretion of TNF in culture supernatants was determined after stimulation with abacavir. Extracellular levels of TNF were higher in abacavir-stimulated whole blood cultures of the abacavir-hypersensitive individual compared with those of the abacavir-tolerant control ([Fig. 3](#fig3)). In addition, TNF levels were attenuated in the abacavir-stimulated blood of this abacavirhypersensitive patient when CD8^+^ T cells were depleted, compared with undepleted or CD4^+^ T cell-depleted cultures, suggesting the involvement of MHC class I molecules and CD8^+^ T cells in the development of this immune reaction.\n\n### Fig. 3.\n\n![Fig. 3.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/245a/384715/986033a6f906/zpq0090440320005.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=384715_zpq0090440320005.jpg)\n\nAbrogation of secreted TNF levels in supernatants of abacavir-stimulated whole blood cultures depleted of CD8+ T cells. Secreted TNF was measured by the Chemiluminescent IMMULITE (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles) method in whole blood culture supernatants from an abacavir (ABC)-hypersensitive (HSR) and an abacavir-tolerant individual carrying HLA-B*5701 and Hsp70-Hom M493T alleles after stimulation with (filled bars, abacavir-hypersensitive; filled stippled bar, abacavir-tolerant) or without (open bars, abacavir-hypersensitive; open stippled bar, abacavir-tolerant) abacavir.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this study we have used recombinant haplotype mapping to confirm a strong genetic association between the 57.1 AH and definite abacavir hypersensitivity, with further evidence that the concurrence of the *HLA-B*5701* allele and a haplotypic variant of the *Hsp70-Hom* allele represents a highly predictive marker of susceptibility. Through the application of a restrictive definition of definite hypersensitivity, this study is likely to have selected cases with a highly stereotypical immunological response to abacavir exposure, and it must be acknowledged that abacavir also was discontinued in nine individuals (3.6%) with minor symptoms that were not diagnostic of definite abacavir hypersensitivity. These data are consistent with another study involving a fully ascertained cohort of abacavir-exposed individuals in France (*n* = 331), in which the prevalence of likely hypersensitivity was 8.5%, whereas a further 4.2% ceased abacavir treatment within 6 months because of doubtful hypersensitivity reactions ([4](#ref4)).\n\nSeveral lines of evidence strongly suggest the involvement of both *Hsp70-Hom* and *HLA-B*5701*. The centromeric boundary of the susceptibility region 3′ of *Hsp70.2* was demarcated by the presence of three non-57.1 AH alleles, one in each of the recombinant abacavir-hypersensitive individuals (cases 15–17). In addition, the telomeric end of the hypersensitivity region is flanked by *snRNP*,as an abacavir-hypersensitive individual (case 16) carried non-57.1 AH alleles between *snRNP* and *MEGT1* (identified by non-57.1 AH alleles at two microsatellites and one SNP loci). Additional nonsynonymous polymorphisms in genes within the *snRNP*–*MEGT1* region were not detected in the homozygous 57.1 AH cell line. A unique gene carried on the 57.1 AH was not identified in the *Hsp70.2–Hsp70-Hom* region after direct sequencing, and the identical translated sequences of *Hsp70.1* and *Hsp70.2* genes carried in the homozygous 57.1 AH cell line and by abacavir-tolerant controls carrying *HLA-B*5701* (cases 19–22) also eliminate these genes as possible candidates. However, our mapping studies are based on the presence of reported microsatellite and SNP analysis in a limited number of patients recombinant for the 57.1 AH. Despite our extensive search for informative SNPs by screening and direct sequencing, there may be an unidentified gene within the *HLA-B*5701–Hsp70-Hom M493T* interval that confers susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity. Moreover, there may be other determinants in addition to *HLA-B*5701* and *Hsp70-Hom M493T* required for the manifestation of this syndrome.\n\nIn this study, the presence of *HLA-B*5701* provides specificity, whereas the combination of *HLA-B*5701* and *Hsp70-Hom M493T* alleles, which are in strong LD in our abacavir-exposed cohort (LD = 0.030, *P* < 0.00001, relative LD = 0.82), significantly increased the ability to discriminate between hypersensitive cases and tolerant controls compared with *HLA-B*5701* testing alone; the combination occurred in 94.4% of patients and in only 0.4% of controls. Hence, in this study, susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity appears to be conferred by *Hsp70-Hom M493T* in concurrence with *HLA-B*5701* within the 57.1 AH. However, the small number of informative patients recombinant for the 57.1 AH necessitates further functional studies to confirm an interaction of the allelic products of the two loci. The involvement of *HLA-B*5701* in determining a MHC class I-restricted immune response to abacavir is in keeping with the CD8^+^ T cell-dependent production of TNF by mononuclear cells demonstrated in this study and with the prominent CD8^+^ cell infiltrate associated previously with epicutaneous patch testing ([14](#ref14)). In addition, patients with a higher CD8^+^ T cell count (>850 cells) at the time of exposure to abacavir have an increased risk of developing hypersensitivity ([20](#ref20)). *HLA-B*5701* is an effective antigen-presentation molecule and is associated with slow progression of HIV and induction of potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses ([21](#ref21)), and Hsp70 proteins are also known to bind peptides ([22](#ref22)) and to play a role in antigen presentation, particularly cross presentation of exogenous antigen to CD8^+^ T cells ([23](#ref23)–[28](#ref28)) and cytokine response ([29](#ref29)). In this context, the *Hsp70-Hom M493T* polymorphism is predicted to affect substrate binding, because residue 493 resides on the floor of the peptide-binding domain of the homologous Hsc70 molecule ([23](#ref23)). Determining the specific role of residue 493 in contributing to the specificity of peptide binding and/or antigen processing will require biochemical and structural analysis. However, it is tempting to speculate that *HLA-B*5701* and *Hsp70-Hom* cooperate during antigen presentation to confer susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity (see proposed model in [Fig. 4](#fig4)). Preliminary data suggest that indeed HLA-B57 and Hsp70 molecules colocalize within discrete vesicles in the CD14^+^ monocyte population of *ex vivo*-cultured abacavir-exposed PBMCs of abacavir-hypersensitive patients (A.M.M., C.A.A., and S.M., unpublished work).\n\n### Fig. 4.\n\n![Fig. 4.](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/245a/384715/a1dafbba3109/zpq0090440320004.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=384715_zpq0090440320004.jpg)\n\nPathogenic model for the generation of a hypersensitive response to abacavir. Constitutively expressed (19) Hsp70-Hom molecules may facilitate loading of an abacavir haptenated peptide onto HLA-B*5701. Abacavir undergoes sequential intracellular phosphorylation to carbovir monophosphate (CBV-MP) and carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP) and subsequently inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT).\n\nWe hypothesize that abacavir or its metabolites may be involved in the haptenation of endogenous peptides and subsequent presentation of “altered self” in the context of *HLA-B*5701*, thus inducing vigorous T cell responses. It is noteworthy that Hsp70-associated peptides can furnish MHC class I-restricted determinants to class I molecules ([22](#ref22)–[28](#ref28)). It is therefore conceivable that Hsp70 plays a direct role in the selection of *HLA-B*5701*-restricted peptide substrates that are potentially haptenated through an abacavir-dependent mechanism. Haptenation of proteins and cellsurface peptides is well documented and can lead to MHCrestricted T cell immunity resembling auto- and alloimmune responses ([28](#ref28)). The involvement of HLA molecules in presentation of drugs and/or drug metabolites in the pathogenesis of a number of drug hypersensitivity reactions has been previously reported ([30](#ref30)–[33](#ref33)), although this is one of the few reports implicating HLA class I molecules in the development of drug hypersensitivity. In the case of abacavir, different chemical pathways could contribute to haptenation reactions, although the generation of a carboxylate derivative after oxidation of primary βγ alcohol ([34](#ref34)) may be implicated, as this reaction may proceed by means of a reactive aldehyde intermediate that could mediate covalent binding to proteins and peptides through a Schiff base-type reaction ([34](#ref34)) or 1,4 nucleophilic addition.\n\nThe presence of both *HLA-B*5701* and the *Hsp70-Hom M493T* variant in one abacavir-tolerant individual, who also demonstrated an absent immunological response to *ex vivo* abacavir stimulation, suggests that there may be other necessary determinants involved in the etiology of this syndrome. Further studies are needed to investigate the functional determinants of abacavir-specific antigen processing and presentation, which should clarify the pathways involved, and the role of modulating factors.\n\nWe also noted that, although increased intracellular TNF expression in response to abacavir stimulation occurred in most patients with a hypersensitivity reaction, two patients with definite hypersensitivity did not have detectable increases in TNF expression. This is unlikely to be attributable to clinical misclassification, because both patients had positive epicutaneous patch test results and one had previously developed a diagnostic syndrome on a second occasion after being rechallenged with abacavir. Therefore, measurement of the immunological response to *ex vivo* abacavir stimulation according to our method does not have sufficient sensitivity to be used as a basis for rechallenging a patient with abacavir in cases where a previous hypersensitivity reaction is suspected.\n\nFrom a clinical perspective, these data indicate that the prospective use of a genetic test involving *HLA-B*5701* alone or in combination with the *Hsp70-Hom M493T* variant would reduce the prevalence of definite abacavir hypersensitivity in our cohort from 8% to 0.4%. When using *HLA-B*5701* alone, an estimated 1.6% of the tested population would be inappropriately denied access to abacavir. Testing for the presence of *HLA-B*5701* and the *Hsp70-Hom M493T* variant would reduce this percentage to 0.4%, based on our data. Given the *HLA-B*5701* phenotype frequency of 8.5% in our cohort, we can predict that ≈14 individuals would need to be screened for *HLA-B*5701* to prevent one case of abacavir hypersensitivity. Taken together, these data indicate that prospective genetic testing for abacavir hypersensitivity is likely to be highly predictive, and, at least in populations of European descent, in which the *HLA-B*5701* allele is relatively common, costeffective ([35](#ref35)).\n\nIn conclusion, we have identified the *HLA-B*5701* and *Hsp70-Hom M493T* alleles as highly predictive genetic markers of susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity. These findings have significant implications both in terms of the clinical management of abacavir-exposed HIV-infected patients and the elucidation of basic pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this and other idiosyncratic drug hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank the participants and clinical staff of the Western Australian HIV Cohort Study; E.

The lack of consistent results may be in part due to the retrospective nature of most of the clinical studies. In addition, endoxifen plasma concentrations are highly variable among patients. While CYP2D6 is the main enzyme catalyzing the formation of endoxifen from N-desmethyltamoxifen, CYP2D6 metabolic status only accounts for 10-19% of the variability (Desta et al. [2004](#CR5); Jin et al. [2005](#CR9)). Thus, over 80% of endoxifen inter-patient variability remains unexplained by CYP2D6. In light of the possibility that multiple pathways control endoxifen plasma concentrations, and given that the pharmacogenetic studies so far reported are not consistent, it is likely that the absolute endoxifen concentrations better predict tamoxifen activity in patients. The multiplicity of studies available evaluating pharmacogenomic hypotheses with tamoxifen have investigated CYP2D6 genotypes and outcomes, and these considerations likely explain why these reports do not provide a clear picture of the relationship (Dezentjé et al. [2009](#CR6); Hayes et al. [2008](#CR7); Kiyotani et al. [2010](#CR10); Lash and Rosenberg [2010](#CR11)).\n\nWe hypothesize that endoxifen concentration, rather than a single gene variation, may be a better biomarker of tamoxifen response.\n\nIn the context of a clinical trial where all patients were receiving tamoxifen as part of their adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, here we report preliminary data addressing associations of disease recurrence with CYP2D6 genotypes and endoxifen plasma concentrations, in the first 224 Asian subjects we have studied in the trial.\n\n## Methods and patients\n\n### Patients\n\nProvisional IRB approval was first obtained at the principal investigator’s (RRL) American institution following which specific approval was obtained from in-country appropriate IRBs in the Philippines and Vietnam, and at co-investigators’ institution (Indiana University), again following which the principal investigator’s institution provided final approval. The parent clinical trial whose participants were recruited was similarly approved by the foreign and principal investigator’s IRBs.\n\nThis ancillary study was begun after the parent clinical trial had accrued 40% of subjects (total accrual =740). Some patients on the parent trial refused participation in the current ancillary study. Thus the patients entering the current study are not representative of all patients entering the parent trial. The parent trial is a randomized clinical trial evaluating the impact of the timing of surgical oophorectomy in the menstrual cycle on outcomes from operable, hormone receptor positive breast cancer. All patients in the trial underwent surgical oophorectomy on the same day as their primary breast surgery, and began tamoxifen 20 mg per day within five days after this.\n\nWe have reasons to believe that the compliance with tamoxifen administration (Nolvadex, supplied by AstraZeneca) is high and thus this factor seems less likely to affect the current pharmacogenetic studies. Specifically, patients are expected to return at 3-month intervals to get their drug, which is free. We have logs recording patient collection of tamoxifen medication. The tamoxifen, endoxifen and other metabolite levels in the 224 individual patients studied to date (*vide infra*) are all such that regular tamoxifen consumption must be occurring. Patients are not taking any drugs believed to interfere with tamoxifen metabolism which issue has confounded reported studies in western populations.\n\nPlasma, leukocyte and serum specimens after four or more months of tamoxifen treatment were obtained in light-shielded tubes from 224 Vietnamese and Filipino patients. The specimens were frozen at −70 degrees C, and shipped frozen in liquid nitrogen canisters to the Indiana University co-investigators. The logistics of sample collection, storage and transport from these foreign countries to the US have been carefully conducted and are validated by the preliminary data we generated. By four months after initiation of tamoxifen, steady-state concentrations of tamoxifen and metabolites are achieved (Jin et al. [2005](#CR9)). Given that the volume of distribution of tamoxifen and metabolites is large, with long half-lives, diurnal and day-to-day variation in these concentrations in an individual patient is minimal (Lash and Rosenberg [2010](#CR11)).\n\n### Laboratory methods\n\nThe CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic, with over 70 alleles that exhibit functional consequences identified. We have genotyped for CYP2D6 variants relevant to Filipino and Vietnamese populations.\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from the leukocytes using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and stored at −20°C until use. The DNA concentrations were measured by Quant-iT DNA Broad Range Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The DNA was diluted to10 ng/μl and used for performing the CYP2D6 genotyping assays. The genotyping was performed for CYP2D6 alleles *2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *10, and *41 using the predeveloped TaqMan Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. CYP2D6 is a highly polymorphic gene with more than 70 different allelic variants. We chose these star alleles because they are more frequent in the Asian and Caucasian population ([Bradford 2002](#CR4); Sistonen et al. [2007](#CR13); Veiga et al. [2009](#CR14)).\n\nTamoxifen and its metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described elsewhere (Irvin et al. [2011](#CR8)). Standard curves and quality controls were run with each sample batch. The intraday coefficient of variance was lower than 10% for all compounds, while the inter-day was lower than 15%. An intra-patient assay was not run for each sample set, but repeated measurement was performed in a subset of samples. The results show that the intra-sample variability was lower than 10%.\n\n### Statistical methods\n\nWe have used our preliminary data to explore the relationship between endoxifen concentrations and recurrence prior to follow-up being complete on all patients in our adjuvant trial. In this effort, we designed a nested case–control study. Our rationale was that using such a small case–control training data set might allow us to validate any important trend in a larger, independent data set collected from our trial patients who will have longer follow-up time in the future (Pepe et al. [2008](#CR12)). Among the 224 studied patients we identified 24 patients who had recurrence, and matched them with 24 non-recurrence controls who were from the same enrollment hospital, were of the same disease stage (I-II vs. III), and had a similar enrollment date. An optimal matching technique was utilized, as implemented by Bergstrahl (Bergstralh et al. [1996](#CR2)) and the follow-up time for the control in each pair was required to be at least as long as the time to recurrence for the case.\n\nThe effect of CYP2D6 genotype metabolic status on each of the metabolites (tamoxifen, NDMTAM, endoxifen, and 4-OHTAM) was assessed using a test for linear trend. The proportion of variance explained by the linear trend model (r-squared) was also calculated.\n\n## Results\n\nCYP2D6 allelic frequencies in the two populations were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium except for *1 and *2 in Filipinos (Table [1](#Tab1)). Frequencies of specific genotypes are presented in Table [2](#Tab2). On the basis of the genotype-predicted phenotype, genotypes were categorized as normal (fully functional CYP2D6 alleles: *1 and *2), intermediate (alleles associated with reduced enzyme activity: heterozygous for *10 and *41), and slow (homozygous for *10, *41 variants and one or more non-functional null alleles: *3-*6).\n\n### Table 1.\n\n|   | Frequency (%) |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Allele | Vietnamese | Filipino |\n| *10 | 58.5 | 52.4 |\n| *1 | 24 | 30.0* |\n| *2 | 11 | 12.4* |\n| *5 | 5 | 2.4 |\n| *41 | 1 | 2.8 |\n| *4 | 0.5 | 0 |\n| *3 | 0 | 0 |\n| *6 | 0 | 0 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: CYP2D6 allele frequencies in 224 Vietnamese and Filipino patients\n\n### Table 2.\n\n| CYP2D6 genotype | Filipino #% of total | Vietnamese #% of total | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *1/*1 | 2 | 6 | 8 |\n| 1.45 | 6.98 |   |  |\n| *1/*10 | 66 | 28 | 94 |\n| 47.83 | 32.56 |   |  |\n| *1/*2 | 12 | 3 | 15 |\n| 8.7 | 3.49 |   |  |\n| *1/*41 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| 0.72 | 0 |   |  |\n| *1/*5 | 0 | 3 | 3 |\n| 0 | 3.49 |   |  |\n| *10/*10 | 37 | 27 | 64 |\n| 26.81 | 31.4 |   |  |\n| *10/*41 | 4 | 1 | 5 |\n| 2.9 | 1.16 |   |  |\n| *2/*10 | 0 | 12 | 12 |\n| 0 | 13.95 |   |  |\n| *2/*2 | 10 | 1 | 11 |\n| 7.25 | 1.16 |   |  |\n| *2/*5 | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| 0.72 | 1.16 |   |  |\n| *5/*10 | 5 | 4 | 9 |\n| 3.62 | 4.65 |   |  |\n| Total cases | 138 | 86 | 224 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: CYP2D6 genotypes\n\nThe data, presented in Figure [1](#Fig1) and Table [3](#Tab3), show wide inter-individual variability in endoxifen concentrations. There was a significant association of reduced endoxifen plasma concentrations with functionally important CYP2D6 genotypes.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d110/3584248/3c14bba88403/40064_2013_Article_97_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nEndoxifen plasma concentrations by CYP2D6 genotype metabolic status in Filipino (n = 138) and Vietnamese (n = 86) patients (p = 0.0001 for trend: normal > intermediate > slow).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n|   |  | CYP2D6 Genotype |  |  | Gene-dose effect |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tamoxifen and Metabolites | All (N = 224) | Normal (N = 34) | Intermediate (N = 107) | Slow (N = 83) | Variance explained (p-value for trend) |\n| Tamoxifen (TAM) | 195.3 ± 240.9 | 207.7 ± 256.7 | 167.7 ± 150.5 | 226.1 ± 316.2 | 0.003 (0.39) |\n| NDMTAM | 353.3 ± 409.0 | 325.5 ± 371.1 | 297.0 ± 238.5 | 437.2 ± 560.6 | 0.016 (0.060) |\n| Endoxifen | 35.4 ± 28.7 | 48.2 ± 39.7 | 39.3 ± 26.6 | 25.0 ± 22.3 | 0.086 (<0.0001) |\n| 4-OHTAM | 1.9 ± 1.5 | 2.2 ± 1.8 | 1.9 ± 1.2 | 1.7 ± 1.7 | 0.010 (0.13) |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Tamoxifen and metabolites concentrations* in patients with CYP2D6 in 224 Filipino and Vietnamese patients\n\nIn these data only 10% of the variance in endoxifen concentrations was explained by CYP2D6 genotype. CYP2D6 genotypes were also associated with concentrations of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, another active metabolite of tamoxifen, although this association was less strong, consistent with the partial role CYP2D6 plays in its formation.\n\n### Association of Endoxifen with disease recurrence\n\nA trend in the data for the 48 patients in the nested case–control study showed an unexpected result: high endoxifen concentrations were associated with higher risk of recurrence. We expected that low endoxifen concentrations (below therapeutic values) might increase the hazard of recurrence. Instead, we found that the greatest increase in risk was associated with high endoxifen concentrations (above 70 ng/ml) and that 25% of recurrences had such high concentrations. A quadratic trend fitted to a Cox proportional hazards regression model stratified by matched set demonstrated a likelihood ratio p-value of 0.002. The quadratic variable was created by mean deviating endoxifen concentrations and squaring the deviation. Because the endoxifen concentrations were skewed, the high endoxifen values gave the highest values for this variable, but low endoxifen levels also gave values higher than mean levels, hence the label quadratic effect.\n\nFigure [2](#Fig2) shows the raw data for the 24 matched pairs. It substantiates the significant quadratic effect found in the Cox model. The *x*-axis is the endoxifen concentration of the recurrence member of the pair, and the *y*-axis shows the absolute deviation between endoxifen concentrations of the two members of each pair. For the recurrences with high endoxifen concentrations, the absolute deviations are all large, indicating that the matched controls all had much lower endoxifen levels. The trend also showed that when a recurrence had very low endoxifen levels (below 20), 8 of 9 matched controls had higher values (suggesting a wide J-shaped relationship).\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d110/3584248/ec1aa1145131/40064_2013_Article_97_Fig2_HTML.jpg)\n\nPlot of the absolute difference in endoxifen levels between members of each matched pair by the endoxifen level of the recurrence member of the matched pair.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe current report is of an exploratory, hypothesis-generating study. The data here relating CYP2D6 genotypes and endoxifen concentrations are consistent with previous reports with respect to genotype associations, inter-patient variability, and percentage of the inter-patient variability explained by CYP2D6 metabolic status. What is novel and provocative are the data suggesting a J-shaped relationship between endoxifen concentrations in individual patients and likelihood of recurrence. That the suggested increased risks of recurrence at low and high (>70 ng/ml) endoxifen concentrations represent findings which may be validated in the future are supported by:\n\nIt is estimated that among “normal” CYP2D6 genoptype carriers, 32% develop steady state endoxifen levels of >70 ng/ml with tamoxifen 20 mg/day (range 71–142 ng/ml) (Borges et al. [2006](#CR3)). Our observation therefore, if confirmed, will carry significant relevance to the issue of optimizing use of this treatment worldwide. In addition, our findings may have important implications as oral endoxifen is under clinical investigation as a new treatment for breast cancer (Ahamed et al. [2010](#CR1)).\n\n## Authors’ information\n\nFrom The International Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Madison, WI (RRL), Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN (ZD, DF, TS, ETO, AR), Philippine General Hospital, Manila, PH (GBU, AVL), Hospital K, Hanoi Vietnam (NVD, LHQ, TVT) and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH (GSY, EH, DJ)\n\nSupported in part by NIH RO1 CA 097375, The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and The International Breast Cancer Research Foundation\n\n### Authors’ original submitted files for images\n\n### Authors’ original submitted files for images\n\nBelow are the links to the authors’ original submitted files for images.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## Contributor Information\n\nRichard R Love, Email: richardibcrf@gmail.com.\n\nZuerenesay Desta, Email: zdesta@iu.edu.\n\nDavid Flockhart, Email: dflockha@iupui.edu.\n\nTodd Skaar, Email: tskaar@iupui.edu.\n\nEvan T Ogburn, Email: Evan.Ogburn@aptuit.com.\n\nAnuradha Ramamoorthy, Email: anuradha.ramamoorthy@nih.gov.\n\nGemma B Uy, Email: gemmauymd@yahoo.com.\n\nAdriano V Laudico, Email: yago_md@yahoo.com.\n\nNguyen Van Dinh, Email: tung_hue@yahoo.co.uk.\n\nLe Hong Quang, Email: bslequang@yahoo.com.vn.\n\nTa Van To, Email: tavanto@yahoo.com.\n\nGregory S Young, Email: gregory.young@osumc.edu.\n\nErinn Hade, Email: erinn.hade@osumc.edu.\n\nDavid Jarjoura, Email: david.jarjoura@osumc.edu.\n\n## References\n\n1.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThiopurines are a class of immunosuppressant and antineoplastic agents that include [mercaptopurine](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=7226), [azathioprine](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=7120) (prodrug of mercaptopurine) and [thioguanine](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=6845). They are widely used in treating inflammatory bowel disease, haematological malignancies, autoimmune diseases and various dermatological conditions.[1](#bcp70047-bib-0001) However, thiopurines are associated with significant adverse drug reactions, and 15–40% of patients will discontinue treatment due to intolerance. Well‐documented adverse reactions include gastrointestinal symptoms, myelosuppression, infection and, rarely, secondary malignancy.[2](#bcp70047-bib-0002)\n\nHere, we present a case of severe thiopurine toxicity resulting in myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity and alopecia secondary to inherited loss‐of‐function mutations in the nudix hydrolase 15 (*NUDT15)* gene.\n\n## 2. CASE REPORT\n\nA 41‐year‐old South Asian female initially presented with menorrhagia and was diagnosed with high‐risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL; PML‐RARA positive). She was treated with induction chemotherapy consisting of prednisone, idarubicin, all‐trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), followed by 2 cycles of consolidation therapy with ATRA and ATO alone. Her postconsolidation bone marrow aspirate showed complete disease remission with undetectable PML‐RARA transcript levels, and she was subsequently started on maintenance therapy with ATRA, [methotrexate](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=4815) and mercaptopurine administered every 3 weeks for a total of 8 planned cycles. Bloodwork at the time of starting maintenance therapy was haemoglobin (Hb) 97 g/L, white blood cell count (WBC) 6.7 × 10^9^/L, platelet count (plt) 185 × 10^9^/L and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 4.43 × 10^9^/L.\n\nSeven weeks after starting maintenance therapy, she presented to hospital with a 2‐week history of fatigue and malaise, anorexia, bruising, and recurrent menorrhagia. On examination, there was extensive alopecia, mucositis and oral ulcers, and petechiae of the lower extremities. On bloodwork, she was found to have severe pancytopenia (Hb 60 g/L, WBC 0.9 × 10^9^/L, plt 4 × 10^9^/L, ANC 0 × 10^9^/L) and elevated liver enzymes (alanine transaminase 82 U/L [reference: 7–40 U/L], alkaline phosphatase 122 U/L [reference: 40–150 U/L], total bilirubin 14 μmol/L [reference: <22 μmol/L]).\n\nWork‐up identified mild iron deficiency anaemia and hepatosplenomegaly with fatty infiltration on abdominal ultrasound but otherwise normal haemolysis markers, infectious screen for hepatitis B and C, HIV, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus, thyroid function, and vitamin B12 levels. A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed hypocellularity (<10% cells) but no evidence of APL recurrence.\n\nBased on clinical features and the absence of a plausible alternative aetiology, a presumptive diagnosis of mercaptopurine toxicity was made. The patient underwent genetic testing and was found to have wildtype alleles in the thiopurine‐S‐methyltransferase (*TPMT*) gene, but homozygous loss‐of‐function alleles in the *NUDT15* gene (c.415C > T; *3/*3), resulting in complete loss of NUDT15 protein function. She was diagnosed with severe mercaptopurine toxicity secondary to an inherited NUDT15 protein deficiency, resulting in myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity and alopecia. While methotrexate toxicity can also cause hepatotoxicity and alopecia, in the context of the identified *NUDT15* mutations, this was favoured to be a less likely explanation for the patient's clinical presentation.\n\nMercaptopurine was stopped and the patient was treated with red blood cell and platelet transfusions, filgrastim, tranexamic acid and leuprolide to suppress her menses. She had slow‐to‐recover cell counts and remained transfusion dependent until her discharge from hospital approximately 22 days later. Her discharge bloodwork showed Hb 78 g/L, WBC 2.2 × 10^9^/L, plt 34 × 10^9^/L, and ANC 0.82 × 10^9^/L. Mercaptopurine was omitted from her subsequent therapy regimens given the risk of toxicity even with significant dose reductions.\n\n## 3. DISCUSSION\n\nInherited gene mutations in *TPMT* and *NUDT15* can substantially increase an individual's risk of severe thiopurine toxicity. Our case highlights a gap in current guidelines on pretreatment genetic screening for thiopurine initiation (particularly for *NUDT15* testing) and key racial differences in the population prevalence of mutations that can help guide individualized pharmacogenetic testing.\n\n*TPMT* and *NUDT15* encode 2 eponymous enzymes that play essential roles in thiopurine metabolism. Thiopurine drugs are metabolized intracellularly to form active thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs; Figure [1](#bcp70047-fig-0001)). These nucleotides are cytotoxic to lymphocytes and induce cellular apoptosis through inhibition of purine synthesis, interruption of DNA and RNA transcription, and inhibition of [Rac1](https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/LigandDisplayForward?ligandId=5250), an antiapoptotic protein—thereby dampening the immune response. TPMT and NUDT15 convert active TGNs into noncytotoxic byproducts. Consequently, gene mutations can result in a loss of enzymatic activity, overproduction of active TGNs and end‐organ toxicity.[3](#bcp70047-bib-0003)\n\n### FIGURE 1.\n\n![FIGURE 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cc96/12035587/9f4e8f2944ba/BCP-91-1511-g001.jpg)\n\nThiopurine metabolism. 1 Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) are enzymes primarily responsible for thiopurine metabolism within lymphocytes. TPMT catalyses the S‐methylation of thiopurine drugs. NUDT15 converts cytotoxic triphosphate metabolites to less active monophosphate metabolites. Active thioguanine nucleotides are labelled in blue. Inactive metabolites are labelled in grey. 6MP, 6‐mercaptopurine; 6TG, 6‐thioguanine; 6TU, 6‐thiouric acid; AZA, azathioprine; HGPRT, hypoxanthine‐guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; meMP, methylmercaptopurine; meMPR, methylmercaptopurine riboside; meTGMP, methylthioguanine monophosphate; meTIMP, methylthioinosine monophosphate; Rac1, Ras‐related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1; TdGDP, deoxy‐thioguanine diphosphate; TdGMP, deoxy‐thioguanine monophosphate. TdGTP, deoxy‐thioguanine triphosphate; TGDP, thioguanine diphosphate; TGMP, thioguanine monophosphate; TGTP, thioguanine triphosphate; TIMP thioinosine monophosphate; TXMP, thioxanthine monophosphate; XO, xanthine oxidase.\n\nMutations in the *TPMT* gene are commonly implicated in cases of severe thiopurine toxicity. These mutations are inherited in an autosomal codominant pattern, and individuals who possess 1 loss‐of‐function allele are considered intermediate metabolizers whereas individuals who possess 2 loss‐of‐function alleles are considered poor metabolizers.[4](#bcp70047-bib-0004) Poor metabolizers almost universally develop severe thiopurine toxicity even at 10‐fold dose reductions. Three polymorphisms (*2, *3A and *3C) account for over 90% of all intermediate and poor metabolizers in the general population, and this increases to over 95% with inclusion of a fourth variant (*3B), highlighting both the practicality and potential yield of genetic screening (Figure [2](#bcp70047-fig-0002)).[5](#bcp70047-bib-0005) Pretreatment *TPMT* screening is supported by randomized control data; 1 study consisting of 783 individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) showed that pretreatment *TPMT* screening compared to weight‐based dosing alone reduced the rate of adverse haematological events by 10‐fold in at‐risk individuals.[6](#bcp70047-bib-0006) Accordingly, pretreatment *TPMT* testing is commonplace among patients with IBD and in other medical specialties including haematology, rheumatology and dermatology.[7](#bcp70047-bib-0007), [8](#bcp70047-bib-0008), [9](#bcp70047-bib-0009)\n\n### FIGURE 2.\n\n![FIGURE 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cc96/12035587/1a71e941ae86/BCP-91-1511-g002.jpg)\n\nPrevalence of TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes and phenotypes. 4 (A) Population allele frequency of the 4 most common TPMT genotypes. (B) Distribution of TPMT metabolizer phenotypes. (C) Population allele frequency of NUDT15 *3 genotype. (D) Distribution of NUDT15 metabolizer phenotype.\n\nHowever, individuals of Hispanic and Asian descent, who are more likely to develop thiopurine toxicity, rarely possess mutations in the *TPMT* gene. Pharmacoepidemiological data suggest that the loss‐of‐function *3 *NUDT15* mutation drives thiopurine intolerance in these patient populations. For example, a 2014 study showed that individuals homozygous for the *3 *NUDT15* mutation tolerated only 8% of the standard mercaptopurine dose prior to significant toxicity, similar to individuals who are homozygous for *TPMT* gene mutations.[10](#bcp70047-bib-0010) Furthermore, the proportion of Asians and Hispanics who possess 1 *NUDT15* loss‐of‐function allele is double that of Europeans and Africans who possess 1 *TPMT* loss‐of‐function allele (21 *vs*. 10%), and this difference increases to 10‐fold among individuals with 2 loss‐of‐function alleles (2 *vs*. 0.3%; Figure [2](#bcp70047-fig-0002)).[4](#bcp70047-bib-0004) However, *NUDT15* mutation screening and subsequent thiopurine dose adjustments remain inconsistently recommended by clinical practice guidelines, and often differ by medical specialty. For example, most IBD practice guidelines in North America and Europe provide recommendations for *TPMT* screening but infrequently discuss *NUDT15* testing.[11](#bcp70047-bib-0011), [12](#bcp70047-bib-0012), [13](#bcp70047-bib-0013) In contrast, all paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic anaemia are recommended to have both *TPMT* and *NUDT15* genotyping completed prior to initiation of thiopurines.[14](#bcp70047-bib-0014) Furthermore, clinical practice guidelines from Asia preferentially recommend *NUDT15* testing over *TPMT*.[15](#bcp70047-bib-0015)\n\nOur case also adds to a handful of existing reports suggesting that alopecia may be an early manifestation of thiopurine toxicity. While alopecia was previously thought to be a marker of thiopurine toxicity seen only in individuals with *NUDT15* mutations, there is new evidence to suggest that alopecia may also occur in individuals who do not possess *NUDT15* variant alleles.[16](#bcp70047-bib-0016) Furthermore, as similarly observed in our case, hair loss often precedes organ toxicity and myelosuppression.[17](#bcp70047-bib-0017) Thus, recognition of this clinical manifestation may help facilitate prompt early thiopurine withdrawal and pharmacogenetic testing.\n\nWe present a patient with severe myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity and alopecia following mercaptopurine initiation who was found to have homozygous *3/*3 loss‐of‐function alleles in the *NUDT15* gene. Inherited mutations in the *NUDT15* and *TPMT* genes can increase an individual's risk of severe adverse drug reactions to thiopurine medications. These mutations, however, occur at different frequencies based on an individual's racial background, yet few clinical guidelines directly reference these distinctions when providing recommendations for pretreatment genetic screening. Clinician recognition of these important pharmacogenomic differences is crucial to guide appropriate pretreatment screening, increase the yield of genetic testing and reduce the risk of adverse drug reactions.\n\nKey protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in [http://www.guidetopharmacology.org](http://www.guidetopharmacology.org), and are permanently archived in the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2021/22 (Alexander *et al*., 2021).[18](#bcp70047-bib-0018)\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nAnnie Siyu Wu conducted the literature review and drafted the initial manuscript.

The *HLA-B*15:02* and *HLA-B*38:02* genotypes were significantly associated with SMX/CTX-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), while the *HLA-A*68:01* and *HLA-B*39:01* genotypes were associated with SMX/CTX-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms; the *HLA-B*13:01* allele showed an association with SMX/CTX-induced SJS/TEN and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms.\n\n### Meaning\n\nThe results of this review suggest that multiple HLA alleles were associated with SMX/CTX-induced SCARs.\n\n### Importance\n\nSulfamethoxazole (SMX) and cotrimoxazole (CTX), a fixed-dose combination of SMX and trimethoprim in a 5:1 ratio, are antibacterial sulfonamides commonly used for treating various diseases. A substantial prevalence of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) following the administration of these drugs has been reported. However, the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and SMX/CTX-induced SCARs has remained unclear.\n\n### Objective\n\nTo investigate the association between HLA genotypes and SMX/CTX-induced SCARs.\n\n### Data sources\n\nA comprehensive search was conducted in CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to January 17, 2023.\n\n### Study Selection\n\nCase-control studies that recruited patients who had experienced SCARs following SMX or CTX were included, and HLA alleles were analyzed.\n\n### Data Extraction and Synthesis\n\nTwo independent authors extracted data on study characteristics and outcome data. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ([MOOSE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/meta-analysis-of-observational-studies-in-epidemiology-a-proposal-for-reporting-meta-analysis-of-observational-studies-in-epidemiology-moose-group/)) reporting guideline and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses ([PRISMA](http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma/)) reporting guidelines were followed. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case-control studies was used to assess study quality. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random-effects model for meta-analysis.\n\n### Main Outcomes and Measures\n\nThe prespecified outcome was the OR comparing SMX/CTX-induced SCARs with healthy or SMX/CTX-tolerant controls based on different HLA alleles.\n\n### Results\n\nSix studies involving 322 patients with SCAR were included, including 236 patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, 86 with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, 8448 healthy controls, and 229 tolerant controls. Significant associations were found in *HLA-A*11:01* (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.11-4.00), *HLA-B*13:01* (OR, 5.96; 95% CI, 1.58-22.56), *HLA-B*15:02* (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.20-4.14), *HLA-B*38:02* (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.42-8.48), and *HLA-C*08:01* (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.07-6.44) compared with tolerant controls. In the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis subgroup, significant associations were found in *HLA-B*15:02* (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.56-5.80) and *HLA-B*38:02* (OR, 5.13; 95% CI, 1.96-13.47). In the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms subgroup, significant associations were found in *HLA-A*68:01* (OR, 12.86; 95% CI, 1.09-151.34), *HLA-B*13:01* (OR, 23.09; 95% CI, 3.31-161.00), *HLA-B*39:01* (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 1.31-15.82).\n\n### Conclusions and Relevance\n\nThe results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that multiple HLA alleles (*HLA-A*11:01*, *HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*38:02,* and *HLA-C*0801*) are associated with SMX/CTX-induced SCARs.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSulfamethoxazole (SMX) and cotrimoxazole (CTX), a fixed-dose combination of SMX and trimethoprim (TMP) in a 5:1 ratio, are broad-spectrum antibacterial sulfonamides widely used in managing bacterial, fungal, and protozoal infections.^1,2^ Previous investigations have revealed a substantial prevalence of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), encompassing Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), following the administration of SMX or CTX.^1,2,3,4,5,6^ In most cases of CTX-induced SCARs, it is believed that SMX, rather than TMP, serves as the causative agent due to its capacity to activate T cells.^5^ The direct involvement of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), genes in the major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) playing a crucial role in distinguishing between self and nonself, has been proven in the pathogenesis of drug hypersensitivity.^7^ Further studies highlighted the variability in the association between HLA alleles and drug hypersensitivity among different geographic populations.^8^ For example, carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN was specifically associated with *HLA-B*15:02* in the Han Chinese population.^8^\n\nTo date, evidence has demonstrated that specific HLA alleles are associated with SMX/CTX-induced SCARs. In East Asian populations, including Taiwanese, Thai, and Malaysian groups, the *HLA-B*13:01* and *HLA-B*15:02* alleles have shown significant associations with SMX/CTX-induced SCARs, particularly DRESS, while the *HLA-C*08:01* allele has been associated with SMX/CTX-induced SJS/TEN.^1,4,5,6^ Among Japanese individuals, a significant association has been identified between the *HLA-A*11:01* allele and SMX-induced SCARs.^3^ Conversely, in those with European descent, *HLA-B*38* has been predominantly associated with SMX-induced SJS/TEN.^2^ In addition to the discrepancies observed in studies involving participants from various geographic regions, there is variability in the reported odds ratios (ORs) for SMX/CTX-induced SCARs compared with control groups. In light of these disparities, a comprehensive review is warranted to investigate the association between HLA and SMX/CTX-induced SCARs. Therefore, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to address this issue, with a particular emphasis on exploring variations in the association across different geographic populations.\n\n## Methods\n\nThis meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022384815) and performed in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ([MOOSE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/meta-analysis-of-observational-studies-in-epidemiology-a-proposal-for-reporting-meta-analysis-of-observational-studies-in-epidemiology-moose-group/)) checklist and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ([PRISMA](http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma/)) guidelines regarding evidence selection, quality assessment, evidence synthesis, and research reporting.^9,10^ The types of eligible studies included case-control and cross-sectional studies. Two experienced reviewers (P-C.W. and I-I.H.) independently performed the literature search, data extraction, and quality assessment.^11,12^ Any disagreement was resolved by consensus among the reviewers or referred to a third reviewer (W.H.-C.).^13^\n\n### Data Selection and Search\n\nThe following basic eligibility criteria for evidence selection were predefined: (1) studies including patients with SMX-induced SCARs and controls (either SMX-tolerant controls or the general population controls) and (2) studies reporting the ORs and 95% CIs of SCARs in individuals who carried different HLA alleles. SCARs were defined as SJS, TEN, DRESS, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis as diagnosed by internists, dermatologists, or allergologists or diagnosed using the Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions criteria. Based on the aforementioned criteria, the relevant terms, including *sulfamethoxazole*, *co-trimoxazole*, *human leukocyte antigen*, and *severe cutaneous adverse reactions* were used in the literature search conducted in free text, medical subject headings, and abbreviations. The keywords were combined using appropriate Boolean operators, and a primary search strategy was developed without limitations regarding language and published data. The primary search strategy involved a CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) search, which was adapted to MEDLINE and Embase (eTable 1 in [Supplement 1](#note-DOI240006-1-s)). The final search was completed on January 17, 2023.\n\n### Study Selection\n\nAfter potential studies were identified, 2 authors (P.W. and I.H.) excluded irrelevant studies by screening the title and abstract according to the following exclusion criteria: (1) studies recruiting patients without SMX or CTX use or patients who took SMX or CTX without developing SCARs, (2) studies without a control group, (3) studies without the analysis of HLA alleles, (4) review articles or case reports, and (5) gray literature that did not provide patient data. Disagreements between the 2 authors were resolved by the corresponding author (W.-H.C.). No language limitations were applied.\n\n### Data Extraction and Quality Assessment\n\nThe following data were extracted from the included studies: reference (author name and year of publication), geographic population, culprit drug, HLA allele, type of SCARs, controls (tolerant or healthy controls), diagnostic criteria of cases, and controls. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of SCARs in individuals with different HLA alleles, including *HLA-A*11:01*,* HLA-B*07:05*,* HLA-B*13:01*,* HLA-B*15:02*,* HLA-B*38:01*,* HLA-B*38:02*,* HLA-C*03:04*,* HLA-C*04:06*,* HLA-C*07:27*, and *HLA-C*08:01*, compared with healthy controls, and the prevalence of SCARs in individuals with HLA alleles, including *HLA-A*11:01*,* HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*15:02*,* HLA-B*38:02*, and *HLA-C*08:01*, compared with tolerant controls. The secondary outcomes were the prevalence of SCARs in individuals with all the other HLA alleles from the included studies compared with healthy or tolerant controls. In instances in which different studies used identical patient and control groups, we incorporated the data from the most recent publication year into our analysis to avoid duplication. We performed subgroup analyses according to different phenotypes of SCARs, including SJS/TEN and DRESS. The risk of bias in the selected studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for case-control studies, which consisted of 3 sections, including selection, comparability, and exposure, with a maximum score of 9 points.\n\n### Data Synthesis and Analysis\n\nWe conducted a meta-analysis in a random-effects model for quantitative synthesis. Dichotomous analysis was performed for crude estimates using ORs with 95% CIs. To assess the quality of the pooling results, this study evaluated the heterogeneity and small study effect; *I2* and the *P* value of Cochran Q were used to assess heterogeneity. High heterogeneity was defined as an *I2* value of greater than 50% or a *P* value of Cochran Q of less than .10 (a threshold for heterogeneity detection). If the number of the study was greater or equal to 10, a small study effect was illustrated using the funnel plot and assessed using the Egger test to guarantee a good performance.^14^ The pooled results seemed to be associated with a small study effect when the *P* value of the Egger test was less than .05.\n\n## Results\n\nThe flow diagram for evidence selection is displayed in eFigure 1 in [Supplement 1](#note-DOI240006-1-s). In total, 202 studies were identified from 3 biomedical databases. Manual screening further showed that 9 studies were duplicates. Of the remaining 193 studies, 148 (76.7%) were excluded after the title, abstract, and article type were screened because they were not SMX/CTX-related SCAR (n = 98), or they were not reporting data of HLA (n = 50). Full-text article assessment was performed for the remaining 45 studies, which further excluded 26 review articles, 1 conference abstract, 5 case reports, and 7 studies that contained no outcome of interest. Finally, the data sources of the eligible studies were obtained from 6 studies. All studies were included in this study for qualitative analysis and quantitative synthesis.\n\n### Characteristics and Quality of the Included Studies\n\n[Table 1](#doi240006t1) presents the characteristics of the included studies. The 6 studies involved 322 patients with SCARs, including 236 patients with SJS/TEN, 86 patients with DRESS, 8448 healthy controls, and 229 tolerant controls. These patients and controls included a diverse range of geographic populations, including those of European descent, Japanese, Malaysian, Taiwanese, and Thai. Culprit drugs for SCARs included SMX (n = 31) and CTX (n = 291). HLA alleles presented in each study were outlined and analyzed according to HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. Most studies exhibited high quality in selection, comparability, and exposure sections, with a score of 7 or higher (eTable 2 in [Supplement 1](#note-DOI240006-1-s)).\n\n### Table 1.

A high heterogeneity (84%) was observed.\n\n### Subgroup Analyses of SCARs Using HIV-Positive Patients and Controls\n\nSubgroup analyses by type of SCARs, including SJS/TEN and DRESS, using HIV-positive patients and controls are presented in eTable 6 in [Supplement 1](#note-DOI240006-1-s). In the SCAR group, positive significant associations were found in *HLA-A*11:01* (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.10-5.34), *HLA-B*07:05* (OR, 5.37; 95% CI, 1.17-24.70), *HLA-B*13:01* (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.01-6.73), *HLA-B*15:02* (OR, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.44-11.86), *HLA-B*38:02* (OR, 4.90; 95% CI, 1.37-17.54), *HLA-C*07:27* (OR, 28.38; 95% CI, 1.46-550.96), and *HLA-C*08:01* (OR, 7.85; 95% CI, 2.08-29.62) compared with HIV-positive tolerant controls.\n\n### Subgroup Analyses of SCARs According to Different Geographic Populations\n\nSubgroup analyses by different geographic populations are presented in eTable 7 in [Supplement 1](#note-DOI240006-1-s). In Thai populations, significant associations were found in *HLA-A*11:01* (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.11-4.00), *HLA-B*13:01* (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.43-6.34), *HLA-B*15:02* (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.07-6.03), and *HLA-C*08:01* (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.07-6.44) compared with tolerant controls. In the Taiwanese population, significant associations were found in *HLA-B*13:01* (OR, 11.72; 95% CI, 5.70-24.11) and *HLA-B*38:02* (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.42-8.48) compared with tolerant controls. In those of European descent, significant associations were found in *HLA-B*38:01* (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.43-12.71) and *HLA-B*38:02* (OR, 75.87; 95% CI, 4.61-1248.87) compared with healthy controls. In the Malaysian population, a significant association was found in *HLA-B*13:01* (OR, 12.78; 95% CI, 3.13-52.22) compared with healthy controls. In the Japanese population, a significant association was found in *HLA-A*11:01* (OR, 9.84; 95% CI, 1.80-53.89) compared with healthy controls.\n\n## Discussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the association between HLA and SMX/CTX-induced SCARs. Significant associations were identified between the *HLA-A*11:01*, *HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*38:02,* and *HLA-C*08:01* genotypes and SMX/CTX-induced SCARs. A subgroup analysis in the SMX/CTX-induced SJS/TEN group demonstrated statistically significant associations in *HLA-B*15:02* and *HLA-B*38:02*, whereas *HLA-A*68:01* and *HLA-B*39:01* were significantly associated with SMX/CTX-induced DRESS. The *HLA-B*13:01* allele showed an association with SMX/CTX-induced SJS/TEN and DRESS, as evidenced by 3 studies involving Thai, Malaysian, and Taiwanese populations.^1,4,5^ These significant associations were also observed in healthy controls.\n\nSCARs are life-threatening conditions commonly associated with medications, and they can lead to mortality and severely debilitating complications.^5,15^ Among the implicated drug classes, sulfonamide formulations containing compounds, such as SMX and CTX, characterized by the presence of an oxygen saturation–amines functional group, are frequently identified as causative agents of SCARs.^1,2,3,4,5,6^ Sulfanilamide (SN), a principal metabolite of these compounds, exerts its antimicrobial function by inhibiting folate synthesis in bacterial organisms. However, the pathomechanism underlying SMX/CTX-induced SCARs remains debatable. Studies have proved that the sulfonamide moiety of SMX and CTX, along with its reactive metabolite 4-nitro SMX, are primary drug antigens responsible for hypersensitivity reactions.^5,16,17^ Dapsone, another well-known sulfone drug used for treating infectious diseases and dermatoses, has also been associated with SCARs, particularly in patients carrying the *HLA-B*13:01* genotype.^3,18,19,20^ In our study, we identified a significant association between the *HLA-B*13:01* genotype and SMX/CTX-induced SCARs in Asian populations, with an OR of 5.35 in healthy controls and 5.96 in tolerant controls. The *HLA-B*13:01* allele was associated with SMX/CTX-induced SJS/TEN and DRESS, as evidenced by 3 studies involving Thai, Malaysian, and Taiwanese populations.^1,4,5^ However, the ORs were much lower than those of dapsone-induced SCARs (OR, 43.0).^18^ Dapsone and SMX share structural similarities; however, unlike SMX, dapsone does not produce SN during its metabolism.^3^ Although docking models revealed that SMX and 4-nitro SMX bind to the same pocket in *HLA-B*13:01*, this binding pocket differs from that of dapsone.^21^ However, results from an in vitro leukocyte activation test showed that patients with SMX/CTX-induced SCARs who possess the *HLA-B*13:01* allele exhibited a substantial cross-activity to dapsone (83%).^5^ This cross-reactivity may help explain the varying ORs associated with *HLA-B*13:01* in the context of hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nOur study had identified phenotype-specific genetic associations.^5^ The *HLA-B*15:02* and *HLA-B*38:02* genotypes were associated with SMX/CTX-induced SJS/TEN, whereas the *HLA-A*68:01* and *HLA-B*39:01* genotypes were associated with SMX/CTX-induced DRESS. Similar phenotype-specific patterns have been reported in the context of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions.^22,23^ Although to our knowledge the precise mechanisms of these interactions have not been fully elucidated, it is conceivable that T-cell receptor (TCR) complexes play a role in the pathogenesis of severe hypersensitivity reactions.^24^ In addition to *HLA-B*13:01*, the docking model also revealed that SMX could bind to *HLA-B*38:02*. Moreover, in patients possessing *HLA-DQB1*05:01* and *HLA-DQB1**02:01 who developed maculopapular exanthema, the activation of CD4^+^ T cells specific to 4-nitro SMX was observed.^25^ This finding suggests that SMX stimulation may be associated with HLA-DQ–restricted CD4^+^ T-cell responses. Additionally, TCR containing Vβ20-1 may contribute to SMX-induced hypersensitivity, as confirmed by molecular dynamic modeling.^26^ The potential immune interactions at the immune synapse between different HLA types and TCR may contribute to phenotype-specific associations in SMX/CTX-induced SCARs.\n\nWe conducted subgroup analyses of SCARs involving HIV-positive patients and controls from 3 Thai studies.^1,4,6^ Compared with overall patients with SCARs, those with HIV-positive SCARs exhibited higher ORs for the *HLA-A*11:01*,* HLA-B*15:02*,* HLA-B*38:02*, and* HLA-C*08:01* alleles. Significant associations were found in the *HLA-B*07:05* and *HLA-C*07:27* alleles in HIV-positive patients with SCARs that were not observed in the overall SCAR patient group. According to demographic data from the 3 Thai studies, CTX was primarily used for the treatment or prevention of *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia infection in HIV-positive patients.^1,4,6^ The increased frequency of HIV-positive patients in the SCAR case group may be attributed to the limitation on the use of CTX for treating infections other than *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia. Additionally, because 3 studies shared the same HIV-positive control group, we used data from the most recent and largest study by Nakkam et al^4^ to avoid double counting. Information regarding CTX dosage in HIV-positive patients and controls was insufficient in these studies, and the association of dosage with the risk of SCAR development could not be evaluated.\n\nWe further conducted subgroup analyses based on different geographic populations. Significant associations were found in *HLA-B*13:01* across multiple geographic populations, including Malaysian, Taiwanese, and Thai populations. The *HLA-A*11:01* allele was significantly associated with SMX/CTX-induced SCARs in Japanese and Thai populations. Specific HLA alleles showed associations with specific geographic populations, such as *HLA-B*15:02* and *HLA-C*08:01* in Thailand, *HLA-B*38:02* in Taiwan, and *HLA-B*38:01* as well as *HLA-B*38:02* for those of European descent. These observed disparities in geographic distribution may be attributed to the complex nature of HLA allele involvement in the pathogenesis of SMX/CTX-induced SCARs. Similarly, carbamazepine, an antiepileptic medication frequently associated with SCARs, exhibited distinct preferences across different geographic populations. *HLA-B*15:02* and *HLA-A*31:01* were significantly associated with carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN.^27,28,29,30,31,32^ *HLA-B*15:02* showed a predominant association with higher risks among Han Chinese, Korean, Malaysian, and Thai populations,^27,28,29,30,33^ while *HLA-A*31:01* was observed among European, Korean, and Japanese individuals.^29,31,32^ The result suggests that multiple genetic factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of SMX/CTX-induced SCARs, and the underlying mechanisms may be more intricate compared with carbamazepine-induced reactions.\n\n### Limitations\n\nIn this systematic review, we expanded on the findings of individual articles by inclusively incorporating diverse geographic populations, such as those of European descent and Japanese, Malaysian, Taiwanese, and Thai individuals. Additionally, the study investigated associations through subgroup analyses based on different phenotypes, HIV status, and geographic populations. However, this study had several limitations. First, most included studies recruited patients from Southeast Asian countries. Further studies encompassing more diverse geographic populations are required. Second, there were 2 culprit drugs, SMX and CTX, for SCARs among the included studies.^1,2,3,4,5,6^ Structural differences may contribute to the heterogeneities in some outcomes. Third, not all studies subcategorized SCARs into SJS/TEN and DRESS, and some studies did not include tolerant controls. Notably, in the studies conducted by Kongpan et al,^6^ Sukasem et al,^1^ and Nakkam et al,^4^ tolerant control participants were derived from the same patient group. To prevent any potential issues of double counting, we used data exclusively from the most recent and largest study conducted by Nakkam et al^4^ in our meta-analyses comparing patients with SMX/CTX-induced SCARs with tolerant controls. Fourth, sulfasalazine was not included in our meta-analysis. Although SMX and sulfasalazine release SN during metabolism, they still exhibit structural differences. Currently, to our knowledge only 1 study has investigated sulfasalazine-induced SCARs, which combined the results of SMX (n = 6) and sulfasalazine (n = 9) using the same control group.^3^ To prevent double counting, we extracted the data for SMX from the study and integrated the results with data from other relevant studies. Finally, the significant associations found in the *HLA-A*11:01, HLA-B*15:02,* and *HLA-C*08:01* alleles may reflect the linkage disequilibrium in Asian populations. The frequency of the *HLA-A*11:01–B*15:02–C*08:01* haplotype was approximately 8% in Kinh Vietnamese populations, while *HLA-A*11:01–B*15:02–C*08:01–DRB1*12:02–DQB1*03:01* was around 2% in Chinese populations.^34,35^ Therefore, the results of our study should be interpreted more conservatively.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we identified significant associations between the *HLA-A*11:01*, *HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*38:02,* and *HLA-C*08:01* genotypes and SMX/CTX-induced SCARs in SMX/CTX-tolerant and healthy control groups. Moreover, the *HLA-B*15:02* and *HLA-B*38:02* genotypes were significantly associated with SMX/CTX-induced SJS/TEN, while the *HLA-A*68:01* and *HLA-B*39:01* genotypes were associated with SMX/CTX-induced DRESS. The *HLA-B*13:01* allele showed an association with SMX-CTX-induced SJS/TEN and DRESS. Further studies that incorporate tolerant controls and a more diverse range of populations are warranted to enhance the broader applicability of the findings across different geographic regions.\n\n## Associated Data\n\n*This section collects any data citations, data availability statements, or supplementary materials included in this article.*\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\n## References\n\n1.

They are used both in primary and secondary prevention to reduce cardiovascular risk. Even though statins are generally well tolerated, their most typical adverse effects include muscular toxicity ranging from relatively common muscle pain (myalgia) to very rare but potentially life-threatening rhabdomyolysis [[1](#R1)]. Statin-induced muscle toxicity is a dose- and concentration-dependent phenomenon [[2](#R2),[3](#R3)], and several predisposing factors due to increased statin concentrations have been identified, including drug-drug interactions and genetic factors [[4](#R4)–[7](#R7)].\n\nStatins are similar in their pharmacodynamic effects, but their pharmacokinetic properties exhibit significant differences [[8](#R8),[9](#R9)]. Simvastatin and lovastatin are administered as inactive lactones and are converted to an active acid form, whereas other statins in clinical use (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) are administered in the active acid form. The main clearance mechanism for the more lipophilic statins is oxidative biotransformation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) and CYP2C9 (fluvastatin), whereas the more hydrophilic statins (pitavastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin) are excreted mainly unchanged. Furthermore, all statins are transported by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 (encoded by *SLCO1B1*) and atorvastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, encoded by *ABCG2*) [[5](#R5),[8](#R8),[10](#R10)]. Accordingly, genetic variability affecting the function of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters can have a profound impact on statin pharmacokinetics, translating into altered risk for concentration-dependent adverse effects between individuals at equal doses.\n\nA recently published Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline on the pharmacogenetics of statin-induced muscle symptoms provided therapeutic recommendations for statins based on *SLCO1B1, ABCG2*, and *CYP2C9* genotypes [[11](#R11)]. Simvastatin acid is among the most sensitive drugs to alterations in *SLCO1B1* genotype [[5](#R5),[6](#R6),[12](#R12)–[14](#R14)]. Moreover, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C has been consistently associated with simvastatin and atorvastatin-induced myopathy and intolerance, especially when high doses are used [[5](#R5),[7](#R7),[12](#R12)–[17](#R17)]. Although the pharmacokinetic effects are clear, the clinical evidence linking genetic variants in other pharmacokinetic genes as well as statins other than simvastatin and atorvastatin with statin intolerance is sparse. Thus, we sought to study the effects of *SLCO1B1, ABCG2* and *CYP2C9* genotypes on statin intolerance in a large cohort of incident statin users linked to biobank and national register data.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design and data sources\n\nThis was a register-based cohort study linking data from the Helsinki Biobank with Finnish national health registries to investigate pharmacogenomics of statins. Helsinki Biobank identified eligible individuals (see Study population). Information on drug purchases was collected from the drug reimbursement registry maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). The registry contains the identification code for drug purchased (ATC code), the date of purchase, the purchased amount in milligrams, the size of the package, and number of packages purchased covering all residents in Finland. In addition to first statin purchase, all subsequent statin purchases were collected from the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2016. Information about plasma creatine kinase (CK) measurements and date of measurements, was provided by Helsinki University Hospital Laboratory Services (HUSLAB). Helsinki Biobank linked information from these sources with pseudonymized identifiers assigned to every individual in the study. The biobank also provided pseudonymized DNA samples from all subjects for genotyping.\n\n### Study population\n\nThe study population consisted of patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. Individuals fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were included in the study: (1) at least one purchase of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin during the period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2016, (2) no purchase of a statin during 1997 and (3) a signed biobank consent and a DNA sample available in the Helsinki Biobank for analysis. Pitavastatin and lovastatin were not included because pitavastatin is not available in Finland and lovastatin usage is minimal. The first statin purchased by the study patient was defined as the index statin. Individuals were excluded from analysis based on the following criteria: (1) index statin was a simvastatin and ezetimibe combination product, (2) index statin was atorvastatin or rosuvastatin which was switched to another statin between May 2006 and April 2007 or (3) missing relevant genotype data. The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective. This led to excessive number of switches unrelated to statin intolerance from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to other statins between May 2006 and April 2007. One subject withdrew the biobank consent during the study and was excluded from the analyses. Follow-up started from the first purchase of the index statin and the study patients were censored from the analyses when they had no subsequent statin purchases during 365 days, they died, or the follow-up time ended (31 December 2016). Daily statin dose was assumed to be one unit per day [[18](#R18)].\n\n### Statin intolerance phenotypes\n\nPrimary statin intolerance phenotype was defined as a switch to another statin from the initially purchased index statin. Intolerance event date was defined as the last purchase date of the index statin before the switch. ATC code was used as an identifier for the drug used and thus change to another brand was not considered as a statin switch. Secondary intolerance phenotype was switch as defined in the primary intolerance phenotype combined with temporal relation to CK value measurement. Temporal relation was defined as CK measurement occurring within a period of 30 days before to 90 days after the intolerance event date. The CK measurement was considered as a binary outcome and the numeric value of the CK measurement was not considered in the analyses. Each intolerance phenotype was only analyzed if there were more than 10 occurrences of the phenotype for an index statin. Stata 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA) was used for defining the statin intolerance phenotypes.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nDNA samples were provided by the Helsinki Biobank at the concentration of 50 ng/µl. The participants were genotyped for the *ABCG2* rs2231142 (c.421C>A, p.Gln141Lys), *SLCO1B1* rs4149056 (c.521T>C, p.Val174Ala), and the *CYP2C9* rs1799853 (c.430C>T, p.Arg144Cys, **2*) and rs1057910 (c.1075A>G, p.Ile359Leu, **3*) single nucleotide variations (SNV) using TaqMan genotyping assays on OpenArray plates and the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Genotyping results were interpreted using TaqMan Genotyper Software v.1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for *CYP2C9*2* or **3* were classified as poor CYP2C9 metabolizers (PM), heterozygotes as intermediate metabolizers, and non-carriers as normal metabolizers.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nCox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate possible associations of genetic variants with the occurrence of the statin intolerance phenotypes. Daily statin doses were set as covariates in the analyses as categorical variables. Genotypes were analyzed as categorical variables using an additive model. In case the variant homozygous genotype group or the lowest or highest dose group contained less than 10 individuals, the group was joined with the adjacent group. The comparisons were carried out for individual SNVs, CYP2C9 metabolizer classes, or for the numbers of risk, that is, variant alleles in the candidate genes for a specific statin including the statin dose in the model. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium *P*-values were approximated with 10 000 permutations. The statistical analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS Statistics 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) and JMP Genomics 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).\n\n### Ethical aspects\n\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa approved the study (HUS/2926/2017). Permission to use the data and samples was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS/359/2017) and permissions to use the prescription data were obtained from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela 9/522/2018) and the clinical chemistry data from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL/161/5.05.00/2018). The research permit was granted by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS 32/2018). After record linkage in the Helsinki Biobank, the data was provided to the study group in a pseudonymized form. The patients had given informed consent to Helsinki Biobank for their samples and data to be used for research purposes as defined in the Finnish Biobank Act.\n\n## Results\n\nData and DNA samples were obtained from 2242 biobank consented patients who had initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016 (Fig. [1](#F1)). A total of 200 patients were excluded from analysis due to one of the following reasons: withdrawal of biobank consent (n = 1), a fixed-dose simvastatin-ezetimibe combination as the index therapy (n = 2), unsuccessful genotyping of relevant variants (n = 68), or switch from atorvastatin or rosuvastatin to another statin in the time between May 2006 and April 2007 (n = 129). The final study sample consisted of 2042 participants of whom 1073 (52.5%) were women. Their mean ± SD age was 60 ± 11.8 years. Genotyping call rate ranged between 0.94 and 0.99 and the observed genotype frequencies were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Table [1](#T1)). The observed minor allele frequencies were nearly identical to those observed in the Finnish population previously but differed slightly from previous data in the European population [[19](#R19),[20](#R20)].\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9549/10399933/9200564d7f77/pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=10399933_pgen-33-153-g001.jpg)\n\nData collection process, exclusions, and distribution of participants according to the statin initiated. *The drug reimbursement policy in Finland changed in 2006 so that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were reimbursed only if other statins were not tolerated or not sufficiently effective.\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Gene | rsID | Nucleotide change | Amino acid change | Heterozygotes | Homozygotes | HWE, P-value | Call rate | MAF present study | MAF Finnisha | MAF Europeansb |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ABCG2 | rs2231142 | c.421C>A | p.Gln141Lys | 0.13 | 0.007 | 0.26 | 0.99 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 0.08 |\n| SLCO1B1 | rs4149056 | c.521T>C | p.Val174Ala | 0.32 | 0.043 | 0.65 | 0.97 | 0.20 | 0.21 | 0.16 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1799853 | c.430C>T | p.Arg144Cys | 0.19 | 0.016 | 0.08 | 0.94 | 0.11 | 0.11 | 0.12 |\n| CYP2C9 | rs1057910 | c.1075A>G | p.Ile359Leu | 0.12 | 0.003 | 0.71 | 0.98 | 0.06 | 0.06 | 0.07 |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Investigated single nucleotide variants and their frequencies among the 2241 Finnish patients\n\n### Simvastatin\n\nThe median follow-up time for simvastatin initiators was 532 days.

The effect was consistent in both of our intolerance phenotypes, the first based on statin switching only and the second based on statin switching and temporally associated CK measurement. By using these statin intolerance phenotypes, we also found a significant association of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with pravastatin intolerance.\n\nMajority of real-world evidence linking genetic factors with statin intolerance is based on either simvastatin users or at least a majority of simvastatin users due to historically widespread use of simvastatin in favor of other statins. Genetic association studies have rarely stratified for statin type in the primary analyses, in many cases due to insufficient sample size for statins other than simvastatin and in some cases atorvastatin [[11](#R11),[16](#R16)]. As the pharmacokinetics of statins differ from each other, we found it important, however, to stratify in the primary analyses by statin type in statin-naïve statin initiators. Otherwise, possible associations could be diluted by differences in metabolic and disposition pathways of different statins. For example, common *SLCO1B1* and *ABCG2* variants differentially affect pharmacokinetics of specific statins [[6](#R6),[21](#R21)–[28](#R28)]. Moreover, simvastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4/5, and fluvastatin is metabolized by the genetically polymorphic CYP2C9 [[9](#R9),[25](#R25),[28](#R28)–[31](#R31)]. A tradeoff of this choice is that we could not account for multiple switches for individual subjects.\n\nDue to the epidemiological nature of our study, the definitions for statin intolerance were based on prescribing patterns (statin switching) or combination of prescribing patterns with clinical chemistry measurements (CK measurements) indicative of intolerance to statin therapy. Our definitions differed somewhat from similar previous studies based on electronic medical records without information about patient-reported symptoms for intolerance [[32](#R32),[33](#R33)]. We included only statin switching in our phenotype, since in our preliminary analyses with simvastatin-*SLCO1B1* statin switching rather than statin discontinuation or statin dose reduction, best-represented statin intolerance. This choice can be rationalized by the fact that statin discontinuation and dose reduction can occur for multitude of reasons not related to intolerance, which are not possible to be identified from the administrative registry data without access to electronic health records. Thus, statin switching is more likely to represent general statin intolerance but it can also be related to lack of efficacy. Consequently, we found it important to include an intolerance phenotype where change in statin prescribing was temporally associated with another indicator for intolerance, namely a CK measurement. Even though CK measurement can be ordered in various clinical situations, it is typically measured when statin-induced myopathy is suspected. Furthermore, muscle symptoms without CK elevation are a much more common form of statin-related myotoxicity than muscle symptoms with CK elevation [[1](#R1)]. Therefore, we included any CK measurement regardless of result to include also milder cases of myalgia not associated with CK increase. However, it should be noted that in the double-blinded STOMP trial, 9.4% of subjects treated with high dose atorvastatin experienced myalgia, whereas 4.6% of those treated with placebo experienced myalgia even after rechallenge [[34](#R34)]. Thus, our latter phenotype is more likely to represent muscle symptom-based statin intolerance, even though it might not be possible to separate between true statin-induced myalgia and symptoms unrelated to statins. The interval of 365 days between statin purchases for censoring was chosen to be able to catch statin switches after a pause of the initial statin. Our statin intolerance phenotype definitions were corroborated by robust associations of *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C with both intolerance phenotypes in simvastatin users.\n\nIn addition to simvastatin, we observed that heterozygous or homozygous *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C carriers had a higher risk of pravastatin intolerance based on statin switching phenotype when compared to reference allele homozygotes. It is noteworthy that the effect was observed in our cohort with low-moderate pravastatin doses as 40 mg is the highest approved dose of pravastatin in Europe rather than 80 mg available in the USA. In a previous pharmacogenetic study of statin efficacy and safety, 143 patients received 10 mg/day pravastatin for 8 weeks followed by 40 mg/day for 8 weeks [[16](#R16)]. Of these patients, 31 experienced a composite adverse event of either premature discontinuation due to any side effect, myalgia, or muscle cramps, or CK elevation during the 16-week follow-up. The *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV showed no association with the composite adverse event. The median follow-up time in our study was more than 2 years in pravastatin initiators, which may partly explain the differing results. Although most statin-induced muscle symptoms occur during the first months of statin usage, myotoxicity can occur even years after statin initiation [[7](#R7)].\n\nWe observed no statistically significant increase in statin intolerance risk for atorvastatin, fluvastatin or rosuvastatin with the studied genotypes. For atorvastatin, no signals were evident for genotype-driven increased risk in our cohort of 780 atorvastatin users who most often had 10 and 20 mg prescribed as a starting dose. An earlier meta-analysis of 13 studies with a total of 1550 patients found that the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV associates with atorvastatin-induced adverse effects [[15](#R15)]. Moreover, in two recent prospective observational studies with substantial sample sizes (870 and 1627), the SNV was associated with an increased risk of atorvastatin intolerance or atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms [[17](#R17),[32](#R32)]. In the former study, 90% of the patients were using 80 mg/day atorvastatin, which is a substantially higher proportion than in our study and may partly explain the differing results. Nevertheless, the non-significant HR of 1.25 to 1.3 for the statin switch + CK measurement phenotype in C-allele carriers in our study is close to the odds ratio of 1.44 for atorvastatin intolerance and HR of 1.4 for atorvastatin-associated muscle symptoms in the previous studies [[11](#R11)–[13](#R13),[17](#R17),[35](#R35)].\n\nThe rosuvastatin cohort consisted of only 184 patients who had most often 5 or 10 mg prescribed starting dose with no tendencies for increased risk in carriers of the candidate risk alleles. The findings are in line with the JUPITER trial in which the *SLCO1B1* genotype was not associated with clinically reported myalgia in a clinical trial setting with rosuvastatin dose of 20 mg [[36](#R36)]. The median follow-up time for rosuvastatin was relatively short, due to a recent increase in its use. This may diminish the sensitivity to identify genotype-intolerance associations.\n\nFor fluvastatin, there was a trend towards increased risk of statin intolerance with a point estimate of HR at 1.88 in carriers of 2–4 risk alleles, but perhaps due to low sample size, the finding was not statistically significant. A previous study in renal transplant recipients with 52 cases of fluvastatin-induced adverse muscular or liver symptoms and 52 matched controls, showed that the *CYP2C9*2* and **3* alleles and the *ABCG2* c.421C>A SNV significantly increase the risk of these adverse reactions, with odds ratios between 2.4 and 6.6 [[37](#R37)]. Our data suggest that these alleles as well as the *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C SNV may increase the risk of fluvastatin intolerance also among general hypercholesterolemic patients, but further studies are required to confirm the findings.\n\nOur study has some limitations mainly related to its epidemiological and retrospective nature. Obviously, some prescribing changes occurring in our study are not related to statin intolerance and cases of true intolerance cannot be identified from the data. In any case, the study answers the clinical question of how the studied genotypes are related to statin switching. Furthermore, we eliminated obvious causes of confounding in prescribing patterns due to administrative factors by excluding time frames where atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were switched to other statins due to changes in reimbursement policies. The study population consisted of biobank-consented patients with available DNA samples who initiated statin therapy between 1998 and 2016. As the Helsinki Biobank became operational in 2015, the majority of the study subjects had initiated their statin therapy before giving biobank consent and samples to the biobank, presenting a possibility for immortal time bias. For the current study design, this is not of major concern, however, as the study outcome was not related to survival. Moreover, the genotype frequencies observed were in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and match those reported for the Finnish population (Table [1](#T1)). Lastly, due to low sample size in the fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin cohorts, care is warranted in making conclusions based on the current study alone.\n\nThe current study has several clinical implications. First, it corroborates the well-characterized association of *SLCO1B1* genotype with simvastatin intolerance in a real-world setting. Second, despite limited numbers, the *SLCO1B1* genotype associated with pravastatin intolerance at a dose range of 20–40 mg, supporting the role of OATP1B1 activity in pravastatin adverse effects. Third, even though no statistically significant genotype associations were observed for atorvastatin, fluvastatin, or rosuvastatin, these results can be used in future meta-analyses and in compilation of clinically actionable pharmacogenetic guidelines.\n\nIn conclusion, *SLCO1B1* c.521T>C genotype was associated with increased switching of simvastatin and pravastatin to other statins in an epidemiological biobank study. The intolerance phenotype derived from statin switching alone or combined with CK measurement appears to be suitable to evaluate statin intolerance. Further studies in larger populations are required to examine the pharmacogenetics of statin intolerance.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank all study participants for their participation in the biobank research and the Helsinki Biobank for establishing the study cohort.\n\nThis study was supported by grants from the European Research Council (Grant agreement 725249), State funding for university-level health research, and the Sigrid Jusélius Foundation (Helsinki, Finland).\n\n### Conflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Footnotes\n\n## References\n\n1.

Although several clinical trials have compared its effectiveness and safety to the new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) [[3](#pone.0145480.ref003)], warfarin continues to be the standard of care in oral anticoagulation. According to IMS Health, over 19 million prescriptions of warfarin sodium were dispensed annually in the US by 2012, ranking #18^th^ overall [[4](#pone.0145480.ref004)–[5](#pone.0145480.ref005)]. However, it is still in the top 10 drug products by reports of adverse events in outpatients [[6](#pone.0145480.ref006)–[7](#pone.0145480.ref007)]. Despite its proven clinical benefits and its use for a long time, warfarin therapy is still a challenge due to a wide inter-individual variation in dose requirements, narrow therapeutic range and risk of serious bleeding [[1](#pone.0145480.ref001),[8](#pone.0145480.ref008)].\n\nPharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithms have been developed to explain about 60% of dose variability in various populations, mostly in Caucasians [[1](#pone.0145480.ref001)]. Nonetheless, their impact on clinical outcomes remains controversial and reimbursement for genotyping is debated [[9](#pone.0145480.ref009)–[10](#pone.0145480.ref010)]. On the other hand, Hispanics have been largely excluded from the corresponding derivation cohorts [[11](#pone.0145480.ref011)–[13](#pone.0145480.ref013)]. Accordingly, these algorithms are limited to account for the effect of multi-hybrid admixtures and the unique stratification observed in Hispanics, which increase dramatically the disparities in translating benefits from pharmacogenomics to this medically underserved, minority population. We believe that a better approach for global pharmacogenetics (PGt) is to guide warfarin dosing by using a pharmacogenetic-based algorithm that also accounts for the effect of admixture or ancestry proportions.\n\nFostered by an urgent need to eliminate potential ethnic disparities in health care while implementing the personalized medicine paradigm, this study is aimed at developing a novel admixture-adjusted pharmacogenomic approach to predict individual maintenance doses of warfarin, after the fourth day of therapy (refinement model), in Caribbean Hispanic patients receiving anticoagulation therapy at the Veterans Affairs Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS). We also compare the predictability of the developed algorithm in Caribbean Hispanics versus a clinical non-genetic algorithm and two other previously established pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing models.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study Design and Patient Cohort\n\nAll research activities involving human participants in this study were properly approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at both VACHS (#00558) and UPR-MSC (A4070109) in November 2010 ([S1 Text](#pone.0145480.s001)). All clinical investigations were conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each single participant of the study prior to enrollment ([S2 Text](#pone.0145480.s002) and [S3 Text](#pone.0145480.s003)).\n\nThis is an open-label, single-center, population-based, observational, retrospective cohort study ([ClinicalTrial.gov](http://ClinicalTrial.gov) Identifier [NCT01318057](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01318057)) as depicted in [Fig 1](#pone.0145480.g001). Four hundred and twenty one (N = 421) warfarin-treated outpatients from the VACHS anticoagulation clinics in San Juan, Puerto Rico, were assessed for eligibility between February 2011 and March 2014. A total of 275 eligible patients who met inclusion criteria were approached regarding participation in this trial. Two patients declined to participate in the study, resulting in 273 subjects enrolled between March 22 and April 7, 2011. To be in compliance with the Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, the first participant was recruited 5 days after the study registration date in [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov) (March 17, 2011). Another eighteen (18) patients were excluded from further analysis due to lack of complete clinical data from the CPRS and incomplete genotype information (e.g., poor call rates) or admixture estimates. This resulted in 255 patients available to include their clinical, demographic and genomic data for full analysis. Because this study required a blood sample at enrollment followed by a retrospective CPRS medical record review, no patients were withdrawn or lost to follow-up. The study completion date was July 2014. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug/intervention are registered.\n\n### Fig 1. CONSORT flowchart illustrating an open-label, single-center, population-based, observational, retrospective cohorts study with cross-sectional genotyping analysis.\n\n![Fig 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ec3f/4706412/70a46bf2e461/pone.0145480.g001.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=4706412_pone.0145480.g001.jpg)\n\nThe study uses existing data collected in the past (CPRS) to preliminarily identify eligible participants from the defined study population (i.e., Caribbean Hispanics), determine their stabilization status and retrieve relevant covariates for performing regression analysis and association testing. GNT stands for genotypes. PHT stands for phenotypes (e.g., therapeutic warfarin dose). CPRS stands for computerized patient record system.\n\nThe eligible candidates were Caribbean Hispanics from Puerto Rico (≥21 years-old). The anticoagulation clinic at this urban medical institution serves a population of over 1,640 patients, of which approximately 95% are Caribbean Hispanics who reside in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The subjects who met the inclusion criteria–stable warfarin dose with at least three consecutive INR measurements on target (2–3 or 2.5–3.5, according to indication for warfarin use) for the same average weekly dose, no anemia, malignancies, renal failure, hepatic disease or any other acute illness, no use of other anticoagulants–were selected from the study population based on their warfarin initiation date (after January 2001). The requirement for warfarin therapy was determined on the basis of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [[14](#pone.0145480.ref014)–[15](#pone.0145480.ref015)]. Patients with low compliance (<80% medication possession ratio) were excluded. Although varying from case to case, the majority of patients were initiated on warfarin therapy following induction regimens that rely on age-adjusted fixed-dose schemes.\n\n### Genetic Assays\n\nThe participants provided a small blood sample (5ml) for cross-sectional genotyping as well as to infer genetic structure and measure admixture. Whole blood samples were processed for genomic DNA extraction using a QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (spin protocol; QIAGEN Inc., Venlo, Limburg) according to manufacturer’s instructions. DNA quantification was performed by using the NanoDrop® Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE, US) and fluorescent staining of double-stranded DNA (PicoGreen® dsDNA Quantitation Kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, US). Fluorescent intensity was measured using a fluorescent micro-titer plate reader (BMG Labtech, FluoStar Optima, Ortenberg, Germany). Isolated DNA specimens were first tested for relevant polymorphisms on candidate warfarin-related pharmacogenes using the DMET^TM^ plus assay (Affymetrix®, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at the RCMI Core Lab of Molecular Genetics (UPR-MSC), and confirmed by either pre-developed TaqMan® Genotyping Assay Reagent kits for Allelic Discrimination (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) or Tag-It™ Mutation Detection Assay for warfarin (LUMINEX xMAP® Technology) at the CLIA-certified Laboratory of Personalized Health (Genomas Inc., Hartford, CT). The African-related rare variant *CYP2C9**8 (c.449G>A; p.R150H) and two other polymorphisms in the promoter region of the gene (i.e., c.-1188T>C and c.-1766T>C), which are not included in the commercial DMET^TM^ plus panel, were individually detected by their corresponding TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Custom Assay Reagent kits for Allelic Discrimination (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions. A full description of these assays and a complete list of variants ascertained can be found elsewhere [[16](#pone.0145480.ref016)–[21](#pone.0145480.ref021)]. The *CYP2C9* allele designations refer to those defined by the Cytochrome P450 Allele Nomenclature Committee [[22](#pone.0145480.ref022)–[23](#pone.0145480.ref023)].\n\nSamples were also genotyped on a *PhysioGenomic* (PG) array that interrogates 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ancestry informative markers across 222 cardio-metabolic and neuroendocrine genes [[24](#pone.0145480.ref024)]. Careful manual analysis was performed on the alignments underlying the genotype calls using GenCall 6.1.3.24 and 50 SNPs with a slight degree of uncertainty about calling accuracy were not included in the analysis, leaving 332 SNPs from 196 genes. Genotyping was accomplished using Illumina® BeadArray™ technology [[25](#pone.0145480.ref025)–[26](#pone.0145480.ref026)]. A full list of the genes and SNPs in the PG chip is provided in our physiogenomic analysis study [[24](#pone.0145480.ref024)].\n\nDeparture from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was estimated under the null hypothesis of the predictable segregation ratio of specific matching genotypes (p>0.05) by use of χ2 goodness of fit test with 1 degree of freedom. Clinical non-genetic and demographic information from the participants was retrospectively extracted from the corresponding computerized patient record system (CPRS). Individual warfarin doses at the first day of therapy (D1, usually 2.5 or 5 mg as per the clinical nomogram in the VACHS anticoagulation clinic) were retrieved from the corresponding records in CPRS. Statistical calculation indicated 80% power to detect SNPs with allele frequencies of 0.1–0.4 in the study sample, accounting for 10% of phenotypic variation at <5% significance level.\n\n### Quantification of Admixture\n\nA Bayesian’s clustering of individuals according to their maximal PG-derived genotype sharing was performed using the *STRUCTURE* v2.3.4 software package [[27](#pone.0145480.ref027)–[29](#pone.0145480.ref029)]. Three Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs were performed using default parameters and an assumed cluster size (K) of 3, which was chosen based on our knowledge of migration history in the Caribbean basin to reflect admixture from Amerindian (Tainos Arawaks), West-African, and European ancestors as well as to match previous reports for a 3-hybrid model [[30](#pone.0145480.ref030)–[35](#pone.0145480.ref035)]. A burn-in time of 30,000 iterations was followed by 70,000 further iterations. The log likelihood for each run was determined as *a posteriori* probability for the different numbers of clusters. Each individual was represented by a dot in the triangle plot of ancestral proportions. Proximity values (between 0 and 1) corresponding to each of 3 vertices in the triangle plot were calculated for each dot. A categorical criterion of proximity was added requiring that in order for an individual to be assigned to a specific cluster, its higher proximity value must be greater than the other two by at least 0.2. This criterion excluded those individuals not clearly positioned towards any vertex but rather located near the middle of the triangle (i.e., the mixed ones).\n\n### Multiple Linear Regression Modeling\n\nWe selected all the patients with complete genetic and clinical data as the “derivation cohort” (n = 255) for developing dose-prediction models. Like in earlier reports, this “derivation cohort” size allowed inclusion of up to 13 independent variables in the final model [[36](#pone.0145480.ref036)]. A sample of another 55 patients from the Brownstone outpatient clinic in Hartford Hospital (Hartford, CT, USA) constituted the external ‘validation cohort’, which was used for testing validity of the developed pharmacogenetic model. Patients in the validation cohort were selected based on the same inclusion criteria as those in the derivation cohort. The investigators who performed the modeling and analysis did not have access to this validation set until after the final model was selected.\n\nA forward stepwise entry and backward stepwise elimination approach in multiple linear regression analysis was used to ascertain the association between average therapeutic warfarin doses (dependent variable) and individual's genetics (i.e., genotypes and admixture index), demographics (i.e., age, body size) and non-genetic clinical information (i.e., dose-adjusted INR, target INR, co-meds use, indications, smoking status, comorbidities, diet) available on day 3 of warfarin therapy. Clinically relevant genetic variants on the following candidate pharmacogenes were tested: *CYP2C9*, *VKORC1*, *EPHX1*, *CYP4F2*, and *NQO1*. Variables were included in the final linear regression model if they were significantly (p<0.05) associated with the daily warfarin dose or were marginally significant (0.05 ≤ p ≤ 0.20) with strong biological plausibility.\n\nThe average therapeutic warfarin dose (mg/day) is defined as the dose that led to stable therapeutic anticoagulation levels (i.e., INR values in range on at least three consecutive visits for the same average dose). The numerical designations of “0” for the *CYP2C9**1/*1 genotype (wild-type); “1” for the *1/*n genotypes (n stands for *3,*5,*6,*8,*11 “loss-of-function” variants detected in the genotyping assay) and “2” for *n/*n genotypes (e.g., *2/*2, *3/*3, *3/*5) were used to correspond to the relative capacity of the CYP system to metabolize warfarin. *VKORC1*-1639 AA status is a carrier code, where 1 = AA and 0 = otherwise; *VKORC1*-1639 GA status is another code, where 1 = GA and 0 = otherwise. Likewise, the numerical designations of “0” was used for the wild-types on either *CYP4F2* or *NQO1* loci; whereas, “1” was set for the respective single carrier (i.e., *CYP4F2**1/*3 or *NQO1**1/*2) and “2” for the double-carriers of the corresponding allele variants in each of these two warfarin-related genetic loci (i.e., *CYP4F2**3/*3 or *NQO1**2/*2). The admixture index was defined as follows (1 = European ancestry, 2 = Native American ancestry, 3 = African ancestry, 4 = Admixed individual). All discrete variables were treated as dichotomous (e.g., Amiodarone user: Yes = 1, No = 0). Effect on the estimates of the maintenance warfarin dose was calculated per number of variant alleles (genetics), per decade (age) and per 0.25-unit increase in the dose-adjusted INR response at day 3.\n\nAll discrete covariates entered the analysis transformed as dummy variables to quantify how the individual categories affected daily mean warfarin dose. To this purpose, an inter-correlation matrix to identify genetic, demographic, and other clinical variables that correlate with maintenance warfarin daily dose was constructed.\n\nComparisons of the arithmetic mean values (or percentages) between carriers and wild-types were calculated with the use of the two-tailed Mann–Whitney U/Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test (for warfarin dose, age, height, weight, target INR range, INR/dose at third day) and χ2 or Fisher’s exact test (for co-medications, smoking status, race and comorbidities) at 5% significance. Analyses of variance to accommodate unequal cell sizes were used to test the effect of genotypes as an independent variable.\n\n#### Model Diagnostics\n\nThe mean absolute error (MAE, mg/day, defined as the mean of the absolute values for the difference between the predicted and actual doses) was used to evaluate the model’s predictive accuracy. We selected the final model as the one that had the lowest predictive MAE. The bias of the dosing algorithm estimates (precision) was assessed by calculating the mean percentage of difference from the observed dose, where mean percentage of difference is equal to the MAE between predicted and actual dose divided by the actual dose ([predicted dose—observed dose]/observed dose) × 100%. Finally, the effect size of each independent predictor covariate on the daily dose of warfarin was also computed.\n\nWe compared dose predictions from our admixture-adjusted pharmacogenetic model for dose-refinement with those from three other separate models: 1) a clinical algorithm that uses the same equation of the admixture-adjusted pharmacogenetic model, but excluding admixture and genotypes; 2) the Lenzini *et al*. refinement model [[36](#pone.0145480.ref036)] and 3) the multi-ethnic IWPC algorithm [[37](#pone.0145480.ref037)]. We evaluated the potential clinical value of each algorithm by calculating the percentage of patients in both study cohorts whose predicted dose of warfarin was within 20% of the actual stable therapeutic dose. In addition, we calculated the percentage of patients for whom the predicted dose according to each algorithm was at least 20% higher than the actual dose (overestimation) or at least 20% lower than the actual dose (underestimation). These values represent a difference of 1 mg/day relative to the traditional starting dose of 5 mg/day, a difference clinicians would define as clinically relevant. We also assessed the performance of the algorithms in three dose groups: participants requiring a low dose (≤3 mg/day), those requiring a high dose (≥7 mg/day) and those requiring intermediate doses (>3 and <7 mg/day) for effective anticoagulation. McNemar’s test of paired proportions was used for the comparisons. Significance level of all statistical analyses was set at p<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using the SmallSTATA® software v.12.\n\n## Results\n\n### Derivation Cohort\n\nThe derivation cohort (n = 255 patients) consists of patients with a mean age of 68 ± 9.81 years, 99% were male and 88% were self-identified in their electronic medical record as Hispanic Whites ([Table 1](#pone.0145480.t001)). The average therapeutic warfarin daily dose ranged from 1.43 to 11.07 mg/day, a difference representing approximately five standard deviations. From the total of patients enrolled, 49 patients were sensitive (≤3 mg/day) and 28 were resistant (≥7 mg/day) to warfarin. Of these, 10 patients showed discrepancies between actual dose requirements and dose predictions using a previously developed pharmacogenetic algorithm in Puerto Ricans [[38](#pone.0145480.ref038)]. [Table 1](#pone.0145480.t001) summarizes the most important facts on demographics and non-genetic clinical data of this study cohort. Atrial fibrillation (AFib, n = 136 patients), deep vein thrombosis (DVT, n = 36 patients) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PE, n = 10) were the most common indications for oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin in this cohort. Potential drug interactions with warfarin were found with statins (simvastatin and fluvastatin, n = 145) and less common with amiodarone (n = 6). Demographic and clinical variables were similarly distributed between carriers and non-carriers.\n\n### Table 1.

Among all these patients, 30% had at least one polymorphism in *CYP2C9*, whereas ~62% were carriers of the *VKORC1-*1639G>A promoter variant. All alleles were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\n### Table 2.

The *5 allele has been mainly reported in individuals of African descent and has been early associated with a substrate-dependent decrease in *in vitro* intrinsic clearances for CYP2C9 pathway that ranges from 8 to 18% of wild-type [[39](#pone.0145480.ref039)–[40](#pone.0145480.ref040)]. Additionally, the *8 allele has been identified in African-American patients [[39](#pone.0145480.ref039), [41](#pone.0145480.ref041)–[42](#pone.0145480.ref042)] and also accounts for a decrease in CYP2C9 enzyme activity of 30% for S-warfarin [[43](#pone.0145480.ref043)]. Moreover, the *CYP2C9**6 allele (g.10601delA; p.K273X) was identified in two subjects of this study cohort (both heterozygous for this variant, but one of them showing a *3/*6 double-carrier status, patient# WPR255); also the rare variants *CYP2C9**4 (g.42615T>C, p.I359T, *rs56165452*) and *CYP2C9**11 (g.42542C>T, p.R335W, *rs28371685*) were detected in four and one additional participants, respectively (all heterozygous). Another rare variant found in these patients was the c.-1188 T>C SNP in the promoter region of the *CYP2C9* gene (MAF = 0.357; frequencies of genotypes C/T: 0.405 ±0.31–0.51, Margin of Error = 0.10 and C/C: 0.155 ±0.09–0.25, Margin of Error = 0.08; HWE test χ^2^ = 1.18), but not the c.-1766 T>C polymorphism (rs9332094). Notably, both of them are often in strong linkage disequilibrium with the *8 allele [[44](#pone.0145480.ref044)].\n\nThe frequencies of the *CYP4F2**3 (g.18000G>A, p.V433M, *rs2108622)* and *NQO1**2 (g.559C>T, p.P187S, *rs1800566)* “resistant” polymorphisms in the study population were 0.11 (95%CI: 0.09–0.14) and 0.10 (95%CI: 0.07–0.13), respectively. There are 18% heterozygous (G/A) for the *CYP4F2**3 allele (95%CI: 0.14–0.23) and 2.4% homozygous (A/A) for this variant allele (95%CI: 0.01–0.05); whereas, about 15.7% of patients carried the C/T heterozygous genotype for the *NQO1**2 SNP (95%CI: 0.12–0.21) and 2% were double carriers (T/T) of this variant (95%CI: 0.007–0.05). Moreover, one patient (# WPR274) was identified as heterozygous for the “rare” missense variant c.134T>C transition in the *VKORC1* gene (*rs104894540*), which is an autosomal dominant warfarin resistance genotype resulting in a valine-to-alanine substitution at codon 45 (p.V45A). Another eight (8) participants are carriers of the H7 “resistant” haplotype, including the homozygous H7/H7 patient # WPR265.\n\n### Validation Cohort\n\nSubjects enrolled in the external “independent” validation cohort (n = 55) are younger (mean age: 60.7 years; range: 23–90 years) and included more female (approx. 64%) than those in the derivation sample. Sixty percent (60%) had AFib as their primary indication for therapy with warfarin. The other clinical and demographic variables are fairly well balanced between the two cohorts ([Table 1](#pone.0145480.t001)). About thirty-six percent (36.4%) of subjects in this cohort are wild-types, 11% are single carriers of polymorphisms on either *CYP2C9* (9%) or *VKORC1* (2%); 5.5% are double carriers for *CYP2C9* variants (including one *2/*3) and 34.5% are *VKORC1*-1639 AA; whereas, 9% are triple carriers for variants on both *CYP2C9* and *VKORC1* (i.e., *CYP2C9**1/*2 + *VKORC1* AA) and 3.6% are quadruple carriers (i.e., *CYP2C9**2/*2 + *VKORC1* AA).\n\n### Model Development\n\nThe respective regression coefficients, p-values, the percent of effect on dose requirements and the contribution to explain observed variability that is accounted for by the model, as measured by the partial R^2^ statistics, are presented in [Table 3](#pone.0145480.t003) for all the variables that were entered into the regression model.

MAE and MSE stand for the mean absolute error and the mean standard error of estimate, respectively.\n\nCombined *VKORC1*-1639AA and GA genotypes explained approximately 2.1% of the dose variability in this population. Moreover, this covariate was associated with a 13% reduction in the therapeutic warfarin dose per number of A alleles. The number of loss-of-function *CYP2C9* polymorphisms combined explained another 5% of the observed inter-individual variability in dose requirements, and it was associated with an average of 18% decrement in the warfarin dose per variant allele. Notably, *CYP4F2**3 and *NQO1**2 variants were independently associated with a 17% and 10% increase of the dose per variant allele, respectively; whereas, the admixed status of the admixture index decreases the dose by 7%. None of the tested *EPHX1* variants entered into the final model. Dose-adjusted INR at day 3 was one of the non-genetic clinical variables to enter the model, and each 0.25-unit increase in this interaction variable was associated with an 11% decrease in the therapeutic warfarin dose. This variable explained approximately 12% (95% CI: 6.3–25.6) of the observed dose variability. Other factors that entered the regression model were age, dose at day 1, target INR range and co-therapy with amiodarone. Overall, this admixture-adjusted pharmacogenetic model in Caribbean Hispanics contained thirteen significant ‘explanatory’ variables. These independent predictors explained more than two-thirds of the observed variance in the therapeutic warfarin dose (R^2^ = 70%; MAE = 0.72mg/day; MSE = 0.99; p< 0.001), which is better than that of a clinical non-genetic algorithm in the same derivation cohort (R^2^ = 60%; MAE = 0.99mg/day; MSE = 1.26). Interaction terms between the genotypes and key co-medications (e.g., amiodarone, statins, azoles and sulfamethoxazole) were not statistically significant.\n\nA polynomial regression model was discarded as the distribution did not suggest a curvilinear relationship between warfarin doses and the model variables. A multiple, least-squares, linear regression model proved to be the best option for the available data, according to the lowest MAE criterion. The stepwise regression analysis yielded the following PGt algorithm to predict warfarin doses in Hispanic Puerto Ricans (as seen in [Fig 2](#pone.0145480.g002)):\n\n| WarfarinDose(mgday)=[3.2463−(0.0181∙Age)+(0.4246∙D1)+(0.5157∙tINR)−(1.419∙INRD3)−(0.2450∙CYP2C9*2)−(0.5442∙CYP2C9*3)−(1.00∙CYP2C9*8)−(0.3793∙VKORC1GA)−(0.8958∙VKORC1AA)+(0.5602∙CYP4F2*3)+(0.3457∙NQO1*2)−(0.7948∙Amiodarone)−(0.0932∙Admixture)] | (1) |\n| --- | --- |\nWhere INR/D3 is the corresponding ratio of the dose-adjusted INR measures on day 3 of initiation of warfarin therapy; D1 is the initial dose of warfarin (mg/day) on Day 1 of therapy; tINR stands for the middle value of the target INR range, as per indication to warfarin (e.g., 2–3 for Afib is entered as 2.5); *VKORC1* AA status is a carrier code, where 1 = AA and 0 = otherwise; *VKORC1* GA status is a code, where 1 = GA and 0 = otherwise; all *CYP2C9* status, as well as the *CYP4F2**3 and the *NQO1**2 status, are codes, where 0 = wild-type, 1 = one mutated allele and 2 = two mutated alleles; amiodarone user code = 1 if the patient is taking that drug and 0 = otherwise; and age is in years. Finally, the admixture index code is as follows: 1 = European ancestry, 2 = Native American ancestry, 3 = African ancestry, 4 = Admixed individual.\n\nTo select candidate variables for the multiple linear-regression model of warfarin dosing prediction in Caribbean Hispanics, we initially examined the independent effects of demographics (i.e., age, gender, height and weight or body mass index), clinical (i.e., treatment indication, comorbidities, use of co-medications [amiodarone, antifungal azoles, statins, Bactrim], target INR range, initial doses (days 1 thru 3 of therapy), dose-adjusted INR at day 3, diet and smoking status) and genetic variables (i.e., *VKORC1* genotypes, number of *CYP2C9* variants, *CYP4F2*3 18000G>A (V433M*, *rs2108622)* and *NQO1*2 c*.*559C>T (P187S*, *rs1800566)* carrier status) individually.\n\nThe admixture-driven pharmacogenomic algorithm developed in Caribbean Hispanics predicted effective warfarin dose with R^2^ values of 63%, 50% and 20% for low, intermediate and high-dose groups, respectively ([Table 4](#pone.0145480.t004)). These R^2^ values surpassed predictability of the clinical non-genetic algorithm for the same dosing groups in the derivation cohort of Caribbean Hispanic patients (i.e., 50%, 45% and 2%, respectively). As expected, our model’s predictability also outperformed both the Lenzini’s and the IWPC’s algorithms in this study cohort (i.e., Lenzini’s model: 24%, 20%, and 7% and IWPC’s model: 23%, 13% and 2% of variability explained for the same dosing groups, respectively). Furthermore, in more than half of patients the MAE value was <1 mg/day (i.e., falling within 20% of the actual dose, which is a well-accepted criterion for accuracy in dose estimation).\n\n### Table 4.

Similarly, for patients requiring between 3 and 7 mg/day (intermediate-dose group: 69.8% of the total cohort), our admixture-adjusted pharmacogenetic algorithm predicted doses in the ideal range for significantly more patients than the clinical algorithm or the two earlier published pharmacogenetic models (i.e., 78 vs 61, 39 and 62%, respectively; p<0.001 for each comparisons, [Table 5](#pone.0145480.t005)).\n\n### Table 5.

In particular, we observed good predictions of ideal doses in ~70% of the entire study cohorts when using our model, with significantly fewer under- and overestimations of the ideal doses (11% and 19%, respectively). In contrast, the Lenzini’s model barely predicted ideal doses in less than a half of subjects that came up with good predictions after using our model (i.e., ~38%, 96/255); whereas, the IWPC’s model only predicted correctly the ideal dose in approx. 51% of participants.\n\nA correlation plot of the predicted warfarin daily dose based on the admixture-driven pharmacogenetic algorithm developed for Caribbean Hispanics as compared with the actual daily dose in the validation cohort is shown in [Fig 3A](#pone.0145480.g003). As can be observed, our pharmacogenetic model predicted 59% of the variance in warfarin dose when externally validated in 55 genotyped individuals from the independent Hartford’s patient cohort (MAE = 0.89 mg/day, 24% mean bias). On the contrary, the two others reference PGt algorithms showed poorer dose predictability in this independent cohort. [Fig 3B and 3C](#pone.0145480.g003) depicts the corresponding statistics for these algorithms (i.e., IWPC’s model: R^2^ = 39%, MAE = 1.60 mg/day, 34% mean bias; Lenzini’s model: R^2^ = 27%, MAE = 1.62 mg/day, 29% mean bias). On the other hand, the clinical algorithm that excluded genotypes and admixture only accounted for 50% of dose variability in this independent cohort (MAE = 1.34 mg/day, 34% mean bias, [Fig 3D](#pone.0145480.g003)).\n\n### Fig 3.

The upper solid line is (predicted + 1 mg/day) of the actual dose, the middle solid line (i.e. 45% degree line) illustrates perfect prediction in this validation cohort, and the lower solid line is (predicted −1 mg/day) of the actual dose. 1 mg/day change in warfarin dose is sufficient to change the INR by 0.5, a clinically meaningful difference.\n\n[Fig 4](#pone.0145480.g004) depicts a typical STRUCTURE-derived triangular landscape with ancestry-specific vertices (i.e., European, African and Native-American in a counterclockwise sense) on which we plotted the results of the Bayesian’s clustering analysis used to measure individual admixture proportions of participants (i.e., the ones used for the algorithm derivation). Notably, a portion of these individuals (red dots) are scattered throughout the triangle area (i.e., not clearly positioned toward any of the vertices but displayed in the middle of the triangle), showing hence a marked admixture. We found that the Native-American sector in the right-most vertex of the SRUCTURE triangle (in green) showed a higher proportion of patients with low-dose requirements (<3 mg/day) than the rest of the clusters (i.e., 33% vs. 19%, p<0.01).\n\n### Fig 4.

The observed frequency distribution of multiple ethno-specific polymorphic variants in these warfarin-related pharmacogenes confirmed a richer genetic diversity in this highly admixed population of Caribbean Hispanics as compared to other parental groups like Caucasians. Noteworthy, some of these variants have been previously described exclusively in either people of African ancestry (e.g., *5,*6,*8, *11) or Caucasians (e.g., *2,*3), but not often coexisting in both of them. Besides, the combination of *CYP4F2**3 and *NQO1**2 “resistant” variants, identified in as many as 20.4% and 17.7% of patients in the study cohort, had only been previously described to be associated with higher warfarin dose requirements in another US Hispanic population [[12](#pone.0145480.ref012)]. *CYP4F2* gene encodes cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily F polypeptide, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes that is involved in vitamin K1 metabolism. The NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (*NQO1*) gene encodes for a FAD-binding cytoplasmic 2-electron reductase enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of vitamin K to its active hydroquinone form, and is therefore involved in the vitamin K-dependent prothrombin synthesis.\n\nMost of existing pharmacogenetic-guided algorithms include only the *CYP2C9**2, *3 and *VKORC1*-1639G>A variants commonly found among Caucasians [[45](#pone.0145480.ref045)–[52](#pone.0145480.ref052)]. Uncommon mutations in Europeans (e.g., *CYP2C9**8, *NQO1**2) are often overlooked and, consequently, the utility of existing algorithms is limited in patients with mixed ancestry like Caribbean Hispanics. A recent clinical trial (COAG, [NCT00839657](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00839657)) raised some concerns about clinical utility of genotyping in warfarin dose predictions [[53](#pone.0145480.ref053)]; however, we firmly believe that failure to account for variants relevant in underrepresented ethnicities (e.g., African Americans or admixed Hispanics) will lead to significant dosing error in these populations.\n\nSimilar to our previous pharmacogenetic-guided algorithm in Puerto Ricans [[38](#pone.0145480.ref038)], carrier status for *VKORC1*-1639G>A and loss-of-function *CYP2C9* polymorphisms were significant predictors of therapeutic dose in the herein developed admixture-adjusted PGt algorithm of dose-refinement within Caribbean Hispanics. However, the *CYP2C9* carrier status (i.e., combinatorial *CYP2C9**2 plus *3 alleles, along with the *8 variant), was this time a better predictor of therapeutic doses in our derivation cohort.\n\nDespite of being the first variable to show significance in the previous algorithm, *VKORC1* GA and AA were now the 8^th^ and 9^th^ variables to enter a stepwise regression model that predicted the refined dose in the new algorithm ([Table 3](#pone.0145480.t003)). Interestingly, *VKORC1* genotypes combined contributed only ~2.1% of the total R^2^, which suggests that the INR/dose3 value captured most of the information on warfarin sensitivity in the derivation cohort. A similar observation was earlier noted by Lenzini *et al*. [[36](#pone.0145480.ref036)] in another dose-refinement model developed in a cohort of mostly Caucasian patients. Moreover, previous reports also found that *VKORC1* correlates with INR response over the first week of treatment; whereas, a strong association with dose vanished during this initial week of therapy [[36](#pone.0145480.ref036)]. It has been hypothesized by others that *CYP2C9* variants could overcome the predictive effect of *VKORC1* in PGt algorithms for dose-refinements because of their direct impact on S-warfarin metabolism, a process that seems to be more clinically relevant after the first few days. Since INR measure reflects warfarin sensitivity but not warfarin clearance, this value will mask the *VKOC1* effect over time. Nonetheless, the addition of *VKORC1* in the final model is expected to partially reduce the INR effect on dose variability, thus minimizing the impact of errors in initial INR measurements. Lenzini *et al*. have previously acknowledged this expectancy; particularly in patients being treated with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin that sometimes inflate initial INRs [[36](#pone.0145480.ref036)].\n\nAlthough the admixture index only explained less than 1% of observed dose variability in this cohort, it represents approximately a 7% of dose decrement for admixed individuals. Accordingly, we strongly believe this variable is a clinically relevant predictor for our model in Caribbean Hispanics given the well-documented stratification of this population in the Island of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean basin at large. An earlier paper by Via *et al*. [[54](#pone.0145480.ref054)] provides evidence in support of the need for adjustments by admixture degree in pharmacogenetics studies within Caribbean Hispanics in order to control for significant population stratification given its marked ethno-geographic heterogeneity and distinctive clines of admixture proportions across the Island (i.e., people with the higher African ancestry mainly located in the east side of the Island; whereas, individuals who have the greatest European contribution mostly living in the west region).\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no previous trials have included a measure of admixture in warfarin dose predictions, even though a few of them have certainly added ethnicity or race as a proxy [[12](#pone.0145480.ref012)]. Admixture can be a confounder that may result in false associations due to differences in genetic backgrounds across individuals in the derivation cohort [[11](#pone.0145480.ref011),[13](#pone.0145480.ref013), [55](#pone.0145480.ref055)–[56](#pone.0145480.ref056)]. Findings depicted in [Fig 3](#pone.0145480.g003) suggest caution on use of pharmacogenetic models in Hispanics without accounting for admixture or ethnic-specific SNPs. [Fig 4](#pone.0145480.g004) shows result of the Bayesian’s clustering analysis of PG array data in order to infer the unique genetic ancestral roots among members of the admixed population under study [[27](#pone.0145480.ref027)]. Based on this result, we concluded that there is an association between the degree of individual Amerindian ancestry and low warfarin dose requirements. This is not surprising given the fact that people of Asian or Amerindian ancestry are more likely to need lower doses because of their higher *VKORC1* haplotype A frequency. Admixed populations may differ from other populations in frequency, distribution and combination of allelic variants in their genomes [[57](#pone.0145480.ref057)–[59](#pone.0145480.ref059)]. There are also important differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) by ancestry that might have significant consequences for the association between genotypes and warfarin dosing across different populations.\n\nOther variables that were not important predictors of dose revisions in our study cohort were body size, gender, vitamin K intake, statin use, azoles use, smoking status, liver function, diabetes, and indications. Type 2 Diabetes shows high prevalence among subjects in the study cohort and has been earlier reported as a marker for lower warfarin dose requirements [[60](#pone.0145480.ref060)]. A possible explanation is that these variables were all taken into proper consideration when initial doses were estimated at the anticoagulation clinic and their predictive ability appears to wane over time.\n\nIn practice, current turnaround time for genotyping results and ancestral proportions estimation could take ~2–3 days. Such an inherent delay limits our ability to initiate dosing based on pharmacogenetic information. Furthermore, various experts consider genotypes irrelevant once INR measurements become available after some days of therapy ([[36](#pone.0145480.ref036)]. This apparent lack of explicit cost-benefit for patients is compounded by the poor predictability of prior PGt-guided initiation algorithms in admixed populations like Hispanics. Consequently, it is not surprising the lack of fully endorsement by professional organizations in the field [[61](#pone.0145480.ref061)–[63](#pone.0145480.ref063)].\n\nHowever, there is a well-documented higher incidence of warfarin-related bleeding events during and after the second week of warfarin therapy [[45](#pone.0145480.ref045), [64](#pone.0145480.ref064)–[68](#pone.0145480.ref068)]. Accordingly, PGt-guided models that refine warfarin dosing are expected to remain relevant in clinical settings after the first 3–5 doses even though these initial doses were not tailored to genotypes. A dose-refinement PGt algorithm can thus allow us to adjust therapeutic warfarin dose once relevant INR measures are also available. Previous developments of PGt refinement algorithms, including the work by the International Warfarin Dose-Refinement Collaboration (Warfarin DR) group [[36](#pone.0145480.ref036)], have been successful in determining utility of genotypes in patients from different ethnicities, even after INR levels become available on day 4–5^th^ of therapy, but none in Caribbean Hispanics.\n\nHerein we present results for a newly developed and validated admixture-driven PGt algorithm for warfarin dose-refinement in Caribbean Hispanics, which showed very good performance, accuracy and robustness in predicting therapeutic doses in the target population. Our findings provide further support in favor of the proposed pharmacogenetic approach to predict optimal individual’s warfarin doses, even after 4 days of treatment, as compared to a standard clinical method.\n\nOn the other hand, our model outperformed two previous pharmacogenetic-guided algorithms (i.e., a dose-refinement algorithm by Lenzini *et al* [[36](#pone.0145480.ref036)] and the PGt algorithm for dose initiation developed by the IWPC that evaluate dosing variability at earlier time points [[37](#pone.0145480.ref037)]), with higher R^2^ (i.e., 0.70 versus 0.34 and 0.27, respectively), less scatter and lower MAE (MAE = 0.72 mg/day versus 1.33 and 1.2 mg/days, respectively), when using dataset from our derivation cohort of 255 patients. Accordingly, these existing pharmacogenetic-guided algorithms derived from other populations (mostly Caucasians) were poor predictors of the actual therapeutic warfarin dose in Caribbean Hispanics, explaining no more than 30% of the total dose variation in Caribbean Hispanics as compared to ≥ 60% in Caucasians [[36](#pone.0145480.ref036)–[37](#pone.0145480.ref037)].\n\nLikewise, the developed algorithm also performed better for the Caribbean Hispanic population than a clinical algorithm that excludes genotypes and admixture (R^2^ = 0.6 and MAE = 0.99 mg/day). After adjusting for INR at 3^rd^ day and admixture, clinical polymorphisms on major warfarin-related pharmacogenes (*CYP2C9* and *VKORC1*) remained significant predictors of effective dose (p<0.05). Therefore, this admixture-driven PGt algorithm estimates effective warfarin doses after 4 days of therapy more accurately than the one that only used clinical factors.\n\nAnalysis in [Table 5](#pone.0145480.t005) shows no significant difference between our admixture-adjusted PGt model to predict optimal doses in the high-dose subset of patients (≥7 mg/day) and the clinical non-genetic algorithm (p = 0.683), but the admixture-adjusted PGt algorithm was significantly more accurate in the subsets with the intermediate (p = 0.0005) and low-dose requirements (p = 0.0001). We consider that our PGt algorithm is particularly more useful in patients who are carriers of the “high-risk” unusual genotypes. As a matter of fact, 54% of dose predictions in patients at the highest risk for poor outcomes (i.e. ≤3mg or ≥7 mg/day) resulted in ideal doses with our developed model, as compared with only 29% with the clinical algorithm. Previous reports indicate that algorithms guided by genetic information are able to correct the genetic propensity to high INRs in individuals with variant SNPs [[68](#pone.0145480.ref068)].\n\nAlthough one study limitation is the single-center nature of the study design, the fact that all participants were managed by the same anticoagulation services (i.e., clinicians, procedures, formulary, dosing strategies, CPRS data entry, etc.) minimizes differential managements that could represent a potential bias to account for variability in dose requirements. Important to remark that the San Juan VACHS-affiliated anticoagulation clinic is the main and largest anticoagulation center in the Caribbean area, with patients from all ethno-geographic regions of the Island of Puerto Rico that ensure representativeness. Nonetheless, potential biases remain in any non-randomized study. Accordingly, we propose this algorithm to be investigated in a larger randomized, prospective clinical study in Caribbean Hispanics. Other limitations of the study include gender and elderly, as well as issues related to the observational and retrospective nature of the study design. All these limitations are also valid for the clinical non-genetic algorithm.\n\nIn general, our findings in Caribbean Hispanics are consistent with those reported in previous studies of warfarin PGt in other populations to predict dose-refinements, including those by Lenzini *et al*. and Horne *et al*. [[36](#pone.0145480.ref036), [68](#pone.0145480.ref068)]. The addition of genotypes and admixture improves the R^2^ by ~10%. The absolute difference in predicted vs. observed doses in the overall patient cohort was 0.72 mg/day, which corresponds to a 14.4% of mean absolute percentage of difference (precision). This prediction error of only 14% represents a difference of <1 mg/day relative to the traditional starting dose of 5 mg/day, which clinicians define as not clinically relevant. By systematically using this novel admixture-adjusted PGt algorithm, we anticipate that clinicians could now estimate a more accurate “tailored-to-genotype” therapeutic warfarin dose in Caribbean Hispanics after four days of therapy that translate into a safer and more effective therapy, with those at the highest-risk likely gaining the most benefit from this approach.\n\nA multi-center, randomized clinical trial ([ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov) Identifier: [NCT02345356](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02345356)), aimed at comparing our admixture-adjusted PGt algorithm for warfarin dose predictions in Caribbean Hispanics versus current standard of care, will be conducted soon in order to evidence its clinical utility.\n\n## Supporting Information\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe material presented herein is the result of work supported with resources from and the use of facilities at the Veteran Affairs Caribbean Health System in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

We recruited 542 patients with hyperlipidemia. The 388A>G and 521T>C polymorphisms were genotyped. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), Serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were measured before and after an oral 20-mg dose of simvastatin. Individuals with the 388AA genotype had higher ALT and AST levels than those with the 388AG or 388GG genotypes (P = .037 and P = .002, respectively). Individuals with both the 388AA and the 521TT genotypes had the highest levels of ALT and AST (P = .001 and P = .001, respectively). Moreover, we divided all patients into normal and abnormal subgroups based on elevated ALT and AST values (≥ 40 U/L), participants in the abnormal subgroup had a higher frequency of the 388A/521T haplotype and a lower frequency of the 388G/521T haplotype compared to those in the normal subgroup. In addition, compared to 388G allele and 521C allele carriers, individuals with the 388G allele and 521TT genotype carriers had greater TC and LDL-C reduction in response to simvastatin after 4 weeks of treatment. Our conclusion suggests that the interaction between the SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C polymorphisms could be an important genetic determinant of hepatic function and the therapeutic efficiency of simvastatin in Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia.\n\nKeywords: SLCO1B1, polymorphism, hepatic function, hyperlipidemia, simvastatin\n\n## Introduction\n\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. A global burden of disease study in 2013 estimated that CVD caused 17.3 million deaths globally, which accounted for 31.5% of all deaths and 45% of all noncommunicable disease deaths. Hyperlipidemia is a major risk factor for the development of CVD.^1^ It is a common metabolic disease characterized by elevated concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with declined levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).^2^ Many well-established studies have reported that all types of hyperlipidemia could arise from genetic factors.^3,4^\n\nOrganic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), encoded by the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 gene (SLCO1B1), is an important transporter with 691 amino acids. Organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 is located on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and small intestinal enterocytes.^5^ It mediates the transport of a wide variety of exogenous and endogenous substrates, such as bile acids, sulfate, and xenobiotic compounds.^6,7^ To date, many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found within the SLCO1B1 gene.^8^ Two common polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 gene—388A>G (rs2306283) and 521T>C (rs4149056)—are associated with an alteration in the transport activity of OATP1B1 both in vitro and in vivo.^9–13^ The SLCO1B1 388A>G polymorphism has been associated with markedly increased activity of OATP1B1.^9^ On the other hand, declined activity of the transporter has been related to the SLCO1B1 521T>C polymorphism.^10^ Haplotype analysis further suggested that the SLCO1B1*15 haplotype (388G/521C) is associated with low activity of the transporter.^11–13^ In addition, several studies have reported the impact of SLCO1B1 gene polymorphisms on the lipid-lowering efficacy of the statins.^14,15^\n\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) are 2 important aminotransferases in vivo. Serum ALT and AST values are independent predictors of fatty liver.^16,17^ Recently, several studies have found that hyperlipidemia, especially hypertriglyceridemia, may be a major risk factor for common chronic hepatic diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver and fatty infiltration of the liver.^18,19^ Although the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis remains to be determined, lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are known to be the primary causes.^20,21^ To date, however, there have been no studies demonstrating the relationship between SLCO1B1 gene polymorphisms and ALT and AST concentrations in patients with primary hyperlipidemia.\n\nIn this article, we conducted a genetic epidemiological study to explore the association of the common SLCO1B1 polymorphisms with baseline plasma lipid levels and hepatic function. Moreover, we also examined the association of the SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C variants with response to lipid-lowering therapy with simvastatin in Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia.\n\n## Patients and Methods\n\n### Study Population\n\nThis is an epidemiological cohort study. All participants were residents of Beijing and Anhui Province, China. The study cohort consisted of 542 patients with hyperlipidemia, including 166 (31%) men and 376 (69%) women. Participants who met the following criteria were considered hyperlipidemic: (1) total cholesterol at least 5.72 mmol/L, TG at least 1.70 mmol/L, or LDL-C at least 3.64 mmol/L; (2) no ischemic heart disease or other vascular disease; and (3) no drug use that could lower plasma lipid levels or otherwise affect the blood lipid profile for at least 1 week prior to the study. Prior to study participation, all patients gave written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Institute of Biomedicine, Anhui Medical University.\n\n### Simvastatin treatment\n\nAfter a washout period of 7 to 10 days, all participants received a daily fixed oral dosage of 20 mg simvastatin for 8 consecutive weeks. Participants were required to take their simvastatin between 8:00 pm and 10:00 pm. During the study period, participants were required to visit our clinical center weekly for blood lipid measurement and to report any adverse effects. Patients whose laboratory parameters were affected by the treatment were excluded during the study.\n\n### Laboratory Analysis\n\nAt baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of treatment, venous blood samples were drawn from all participants at the research center after an overnight fast. Blood samples were stored in EDTA tubes and centrifuged at 2500 r/min for 10 minutes to acquire the serum. Plasma lipid levels (TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C) were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assays (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Alanine aminotransferase and AST levels were measured by reflective photometry using an automatic biochemistry analyzer. The automatic biochemistry analyzer based on the spectrophotometric principle is one of the necessary instruments for clinical diagnostics in a hospital. The SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C polymorphisms were genotyped by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. The primers were as follows: SLCO1B1 388A>G forward 5’-ATA ATG GTG CAA ATA AAG GGG-3’ and reverse 5’-ACT ATC TCA GGT GAT GCT CTA-3’, SLCO1B1 521T>C forward 5’-AAA GGA ATC TGG GTC ATA CAT GTG GAT ATA CG-3’ and reverse 5’-TTC AAA AGT AGA CAA AGG GAA AGT GAT CAT-3’. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions for 388A>G were 5 minutes at 94°C for initial denaturation, followed by 36 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 57°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds, with a final extension at 72°C for 6 minutes. For 521T>C, the conditions were 5 minutes at 94°C for initial denaturation, followed by 36 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 57°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds, with a final extension at 72°C for 6 minutes. After PCR amplification, restriction enzyme digestion was accomplished with Hinf I (at 37°C for 3 hours) for the 388A>G polymorphism (divided into 214∼, 129∼, and 85 base pair [bp]) and Mlu I (at 37°C for 4 hours) for the 521T>C polymorphism (divided into 196∼, 162∼, and 34 bp). The digestion products were then separated on 3% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining.\n\n### Statistical Analysis\n\nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS 19.0 (IBM Inc, Armonk, New York). Continuous data were presented as mean (standard deviation), and categorical data were expressed as counts and proportions. Deviation of the genotype distributions for the 2 polymorphisms from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested with the χ^2^ test. Student *t* test and 1-way analysis of variance were used to compare the mean differences for continuous variables. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between the plasma compounds measuring hepatic function and lipid levels and the SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C polymorphisms. The estimated haplotype frequencies were calculated using PHASE 2.1 software. Value of *P* < .05 were considered to be significant.\n\n## Results\n\n### Baseline Clinical and Epidemiologic Characteristics\n\nA total of 542 patients with hyperlipidemia were enrolled to participate in our study. As shown in [Table 1](#table1-1076029618805863), the genotype distribution of SLCO1B1 genotype distribution of the SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C polymorphisms did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (*P* = .419 and *P* = .233, respectively). For all of the study participants, the minor allele frequencies observed for 388A>G and 521T>C were 0.28 and 0.11, respectively.

In a dominant model, the average ALT and AST levels were significantly higher in patients with the homozygous 388AA than in those with the 388AG or 388GG genotypes in both the unadjusted and the adjusted models. After adjustment for important covariates, including age, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, and smoking, the average HDL-C level was significantly higher in patients with the 388AA genotype than in those with the 388AG or 388GG genotypes (*P* = .049). However, no significant relationships between the baseline plasma compounds measuring hepatic function and lipid levels and the SLCO1B1 521T>C polymorphism were found in either the unadjusted or the adjusted models (data not shown).\n\n### Table 3.\n\n| Variable | 388A>G | N | Mean (SD) | Unadjusted |  |  | Adjusted |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| β | SE | P Value | β | SE | P Value |  |  |  |  |\n| ALT | GG | 283 | 27.4 (22.3) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| AG | 212 | 28.0 (16.0) | 0.675 | 1.803 | .708 | 0.355 | 1.767 | .841 |  |\n| AA | 47 | 34.7 (18.9) | 3.685 | 1.72 | .033 | 2.988 | 1.686 | .077 |  |\n| AG+GG | 495 | 27.6 (19.8) |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |\n| AA | 47 | 34.7 (18.9) | 7.081 | 3.051 | .019 | 6.137 | 2.939 | .037 |  |\n| AST | GG | 283 | 29.8 (10.8) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| AG | 212 | 30.6 (10.9) | 0.798 | 0.987 | .419 | 0.786 | 0.977 | .422 |  |\n| AA | 47 | 35.3 (12.8) | 2.778 | 0.877 | .002 | 2.703 | 0.872 | .002 |  |\n| AG+GG | 495 | 30.1 (10.9) |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |\n| AA | 47 | 35.3 (12.8) | 5.214 | 1.686 | .002 | 5.253 | 1.667 | .002 |  |\n| HDL-C | GG | 283 | 1.7 (0.5) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| AG | 212 | 1.8 (0.5) | 0.042 | 0.046 | .364 | 0.043 | 0.043 | .316 |  |\n| AA | 47 | 1.9 (0.5) | 0.067 | 0.038 | .081 | 0.08 | 0.037 | .030 |  |\n| AG+GG | 495 | 1.7 (0.5) |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |\n| AA | 47 | 1.9 (0.5) | 0.117 | 0.077 | .13 | 0.143 | 0.072 | .049 |  |\n| LDL-C | GG | 283 | 3.8 (0.7) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| AG | 212 | 3.9 (0.7) | 0.042 | 0.063 | .509 | 0.044 | 0.062 | .482 |  |\n| AA | 47 | 3.8 (0.7 | −0.013 | 0.053 | .812 | −0.013 | 0.052 | .805 |  |\n| AG+GG | 495 | 3.8 (0.7) |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |\n| AA | 47 | 3.8 (0.7) | −0.043 | 0.106 | .684 | −0.052 | 0.104 | .616 |  |\n| TG | GG | 283 | 1.9 (0.9) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| AG | 212 | 1.9 (0.9) | 0.035 | 0.081 | .663 | 0.011 | 0.077 | .886 |  |\n| AA | 47 | 1.8 (0.9 | −0.034 | 0.069 | .622 | −0.077 | 0.064 | .226 |  |\n| AG+GG | 495 | 1.9 (0.9) |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |\n| AA | 47 | 1.8 (0.9) | −0.083 | 0.135 | .542 | −0.142 | 0.129 | .27 |  |\n| TC | GG | 283 | 6.4 (0.6) |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| AG | 212 | 6.5 (0.6) | 0.058 | 0.056 | .3 | 0.055 | 0.055 | .325 |  |\n| AA | 47 | 6.5 (0.6) | 0.058 | 0.049 | .24 | 0.058 | 0.049 | .239 |  |\n| AG+GG | 495 | 6.5 (0.6) |   |   |   |   |   |   |  |\n| AA | 47 | 6.5 (0.6) | 0.091 | 0.093 | .33 | 0.092 | 0.093 | .323 |  |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Multiple Regression Analysis for the Association Between the SLCO1B1 388A>G Polymorphism and Lipid Levels.a\n\n### Odds Ratios of the SLCO1B1 G Allele by Dichotomized ALT and AST Level Stratum\n\nAs shown in [Table 4](#table4-1076029618805863), we divided all patients into 2 subgroups based on baseline ALT and AST critical values. The average ALT levels in the normal (ALT < 40 U/L) and abnormal (ALT ≥ 40 U/L) subgroups were 22.6 (8.0) and 59.0 (2.8) U/L, respectively; the average AST levels in the normal (AST < 40 U/L) and abnormal (AST ≥ 40 U/L) subgroups were 26.9 (7.1) and 49.3 (9.3) U/L, respectively. Compared to participants in the normal subgroup of baseline ALT levels, the adjusted odds of carrying the 388G allele (388AG or 388GG genotype) among the participants in the abnormal subgroup was 0.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-0.9). Similarly, compared to the participants in the normal subgroup of baseline AST levels, the adjusted odds of carrying the 388G allele (388AG or 388GG genotype) among the participants in the abnormal subgroup was 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2-1.0). However, no significant associations between the 521T>C polymorphism and baseline ALT and AST levels were found in either the unadjusted or adjusted models (data not shown).\n\n### Table 4.\n\n| Category | Baseline | Genotype |  | Unadjusted |  |  | Adjusted |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mean (SD) | AA | AG+GG | OR | 95%CI | P Value | OR | 95%CI | P Value |  |\n| ALT |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Normal | 22.6 (8.0) | 33 | 425 |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Abnormal | 59.0 (32.8) | 14 | 70 | 0.4 | 0.2-0.8 | .006 | 0.4 | 0.2-0.9 | .018 |\n| AST |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Normal | 26.9 (7.1) | 34 | 420 |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| Abnormal | 49.3 (9.3) | 13 | 75 | 0.5 | 0.2-0.9 | .029 | 0.5 | 0.2-1.0 | .038 |\n\nTable 4 Caption: Odds Ratios of the SLCO1B1 388 AG+GG Genotype by Dichotomized ALT and AST Level Stratum.a\n\n### Multiple Regression Models Analyzing the Joint Associations of the 2 Polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 Gene With ALT and AST Levels\n\n[Table 5](#table5-1076029618805863) showed the effects of gene–gene interaction on ALT and AST levels. We found that, compared with the 388G and 521C allele carriers, the patients with the 388AA and 521TT genotypes had significantly higher concentrations of ALT and AST.

As shown in [Table 6](#table6-1076029618805863), when comparing between the dichotomized ALT and AST groups, the results of haplotype analysis indicated that participants in the abnormal subgroup had a higher frequency of the 388A/521 T and a lower frequency of the 388G/521 T in comparison with those in the normal subgroup.\n\n### Table 6.\n\n| Haplotype | ALT |  | P1 | AST |  | P2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Normal | Abnormal | Normal | Abnormal |  |  |  |\n| n | 458 | 84 |   | 454 | 88 |   |\n| 388A/521T | 244 (0.27) | 58 (0.35) | 0.038 | 238 (0.26) | 64 (0.36) | 0.007 |\n| 388A/521C | 4 (0.00) | 0 (0.00) |   | 4 (0.00) | 0 (0.00) |   |\n| 388G/521T | 570 (0.62) | 91 (0.54) | 0.04 | 566 (0.62) | 95 (0.54) | 0.032 |\n| 388G/521C | 98 (0.11) | 19 (0.11) | 0.817 | 100 (0.11) | 17 (0.1) | 0.583 |\n\nTable 6 Caption: The SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C Haplotype Distributions in Normal and Abnormal Groups.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis genetic epidemiological study analyzed the relationship of 2 SNPs in the SLCO1B1 gene with hepatic function, baseline lipid levels, and the lipid-lowering efficacy of simvastatin in Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia. Our results suggested that the average HDL-C levels were significantly higher in patients with the 388AA genotype than in those with the 388AG and 388GG genotypes (*P* = .049). Compared to the normal ALT subgroup, the adjusted odds of having the 388AG or 388GG genotype among the participants in the abnormal subgroup was 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.9). Compared to the participants in the normal AST subgroup, the adjusted odds of having the 388AG or 388GG genotype among the participants in the abnormal subgroup was 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2-1.0). Moreover, when comparing the normal and abnormal groups for either ALT or AST levels, the results of haplotype analysis indicated that the abnormal subgroup had a higher frequency of the 388A/521 T and a lower frequency of the 388G/521 T in comparison to the normal subgroup. These findings need to be replicated and expanded to a larger population of patients with primary hyperlipidemia in order to fully understand the associations of the SLCO1B1 polymorphisms with hepatic function and the therapeutic efficacy of simvastatin.\n\nThe exact mechanism associating ALT and AST with genetic variants in the SLCO1B1 gene is poorly understood. The limited evidence available has mainly focused on the relationships among the SLCO1B1 gene, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, TG, free fatty acids (FFA), ALT, and AST. The liver plays an important role by removing FFA from the blood. Triglyceride in the liver can be utilized as a metabolic fuel through oxidation, exported out of the hepatocyte as very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), or stored in the liver.^22^ The primary sources of TG synthesis in hepatocytes are FFA, which can be derived from food and de novo lipogenesis in the liver.^22,23^ In patients with hyperlipidemia, the greater splanchnic consumption of oxygen does not suffice to balance the increased uptake of FFA. This results in a small portion of FFA being oxidized to ketone bodies, CO_2_, and water, while two-thirds of FFA escape from oxidation and are stored in the liver.^24^ This FFA imbalance between inputs and outputs may lead to steatosis and possibly contributes to inflammation and subsequent downstream effects.^24^ In addition, the common symptoms of fatty liver disease are characterized by elevated ALT and AST levels.^19,20,25^ Bile acids are substrates of OATP1B1 and play an essential role in lipid absorption, including fatty acids.^26–29^ Xiang et al found that individuals with the 388AA-521TT genotypes had significantly higher bile acid levels than those with the 388GG-521TT genotypes.^30^ Thus, in our study, it could be inferred that participants with the 388G/521 T haplotype may have lower levels of serum bile acids, which reduces the absorption of fatty acids by the liver, eventually inhibiting the formation of fatty liver and decreasing ALT and AST levels.\n\nIn our study, individuals with the 388G allele and 521TT genotype carriers showed significantly greater TC and LDL-C lowering responses to simvastatin treatment after 4 weeks than those with the 388G allele and 521C allele carriers (Supplemental Table 3). Similar to our result, a previous pharmaogenetic study demonstrated a significant attenuated LDL-C lowering in carriers of the 388G/521C haplotype after pravastatin treatment.^31^ Sufficient studies have reported that OATP1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of statins can be key in enhancing their therapeutic efficacy.^32^ The polymorphisms of 388A>G have been associated with elevated activity of the OATP1B1 and may lower simvastatin acid concentration in plasma.^33,34^ The 521C variant allele, especially in the homozygous status, markedly impairs the catabolism of statins, which leads to higher blood levels and reduces their cholesterol-lowering efficacy after an oral dose.^35^ Thus, individuals with the 388G allele and 521TT genotype carriers had significantly higher therapeutic response to a single 20 mg dosage of simvastatin.\n\nOn the contrary, no significant associations were found between the 521T>C and 388A>G polymorphisms and the lipid-lowering effects of simvastatin treatment after 8 weeks (data not shown). Sortica et al have reported that the SLCO1B1 haplotype showed no statistically significant mean percentage reduction in lipid and lipoprotein levels after simvastatin treatment for 6 months.^36^ In addition, Takane et al have also found that the association between the 2 polymorphisms, and the LDL-C lowering effect of pravastatin treatment was lost when the analysis was repeated after 1 year.^37^ This may suggest that the interactions between the 2 polymorphisms could be predictive of a slower rather than a prolonged attenuated response to statin therapy.\n\nFew results were found in previous studies investigating the association between the SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and baseline lipid levels. Consistent with our conclusion, Prado et al have found that patients with the AA genotype had higher baseline HDL-C levels than patients with the AG or GG genotype.^35^ However, conflicting results from Shabana et al indicated that participants with the GG genotype had higher baseline HDL-C levels than the participants with AA and AG genotypes, although this difference did not reach statistical significance with a small sample size of just 50 participants.^15^\n\nDespite their excellent lipid-lowering efficacy, statins remain underused in clinical practice, partly because of concerns over adverse drug events affecting the musculoskeletal system.^38,39^ Thus, our current study also investigated the association between statin-induced elevations in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels and the SLCO1B1 gene polymorphisms. Supplemental Table 7 showed that there was a significant increase in CK levels after both 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. However, no associations between the SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C genotypes and the presence of CK elevations were found (Supplemental Tables 8 and 9). Similar to our results, Santos et al found no significant effects of the SLCO1B1 388A>G and 521T>C polymorphisms or haplotypes on CK elevations after atorvastatin treatment.^40^ Nevertheless, Ferrari et al found a contradictory result when participants with either the 388G or the 521C allele had a higher risk of CK elevation.^41^ Brunham et al also found that the SLCO1B1 521T>C polymorphism was significantly associated with myopathy in patients who received simvastatin.^39^ The genetic structural difference between Eastern and Western populations might be a major reason for these differences. Of course, the statin-induced adverse effects depend on the drug dosage as well. This association needs to be further addressed in larger cohort studies.\n\nTwo limitations of our study should be mentioned. First, as is well known, hyperlipidemia is closely associated with fatty liver, but we omitted the effect of fatty liver in the participants. Second, we did not detect the concentrations of bile acids in our participants, meaning we could not determine whether the associations between the polymorphisms of the SLCO1B1 gene and ALT and AST levels were mediated by bile acids levels.\n\nIn conclusion, our study revealed that the SLCO1B1 polymorphisms were related with ALT and AST concentrations and could further influence the efficacy of simvastatin treatment. In clinical practice, identifying genetic variants or haplotypes may be helpful to predict the concentrations of ALT and AST and to guide individualized therapy in patients with hyperlipidemia.\n\n## Supplemental Material\n\nSupplementary_Table for Associations of the SLCO1B1 Polymorphisms With Hepatic Function, Baseline Lipid Levels, and Lipid-lowering Response to Simvastatin in Patients With Hyperlipidemia by Xiangyu Wu, Chen Gong, Justin Weinstock, Jun Cheng, Shengnan Hu, Scott A.

Rifampicin, a critical component of tuberculosis (TB) therapy is a potent inducer of CYP enzyme activity. Polymorphisms of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 are associated with altered activity of hepatic enzyme in the liver and pharmacokinetics resulting in treatment efficacy. This study aimed to investigate whether CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 polymorphisms had effects on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations when co-administered with rifampicin in HIV/TB co-infected Thai adults.\n\n**Results:** \nWe studied 124 rifampicin recipients with concurrent HIV-1/TB coinfection, receiving efavirenz (600 mg/day) (n = 65) or nevirapine (400 mg/day) (n = 59) based antiretroviral therapy (ART). The frequencies of GG, GT and TT genotypes of CYP2B6-G516T were 38.46%, 47.69% and 13.85% in efavirenz group and 44.07%, 52.54% and 3.39% in nevirapine group, respectively. The mean 12-hour post-dose plasma efavirenz concentration in patients with TT genotype at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation (10.97 ± 2.32, 13.62 ± 4.21 and 8.48 ± 1.30 mg/L, respectively) were significantly higher than those with GT (3.43 ± 0.29, 3.35 ± 0.27 and 3.21 ± 0.22 mg/L, respectively) (p < 0.0001) or GG genotypes (2.88 ± 0.33, 2.45 ± 0.26 and 2.08 ± 0.16 mg/L, respectively) (p < 0.0001). Likewise, the mean 12-hour post-dose plasma nevirapine concentration in patients carrying TT genotype at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation (14.09 ± 9.49, 7.94 ± 2.76 and 9.44 ± 0.17 mg/L, respectively) tended to be higher than those carrying GT (5.65 ± 0.54, 5.58 ± 0.48 and 7.03 ± 0.64 mg/L, respectively) or GG genotypes (5.42 ± 0.48, 5.34 ± 0.50 and 6.43 ± 0.64 mg/L, respectively) (p = 0.003, p = 0.409 and p = 0.448, respectively). Compared with the effects of CYP2B6-516TT genotype, we could observe only small effects of rifampicin on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine levels. After 12 weeks of both drug regimens, there was a trend towards higher percentage of patients with CYP2B6-TT genotype who achieved HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL compared to those with GT or GG genotypes. This is the first report to demonstrate the effects of CYP2B6 G516T polymorphisms on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations when co-administered with rifampicin in HIV/TB co-infected Thai adults.\n\n**Conclusions:** \nCYP2B6-TT genotype had impact on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations, while rifampicin co-administration had only small effects.\n\n### Background\n\nCytochrome P450 2B6 *(CYP2B6) *metabolizes efavirenz and nevirapine, the major core antiretroviral drugs for HIV in Thailand.

The frequencies of GG, GT and TT genotypes of *CYP2B6*-G516T were 38.46%, 47.69% and 13.85% in efavirenz group and 44.07%, 52.54% and 3.39% in nevirapine group, respectively. The mean 12-hour post-dose plasma efavirenz concentration in patients with TT genotype at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation (10.97 ± 2.32, 13.62 ± 4.21 and 8.48 ± 1.30 mg/L, respectively) were significantly higher than those with GT (3.43 ± 0.29, 3.35 ± 0.27 and 3.21 ± 0.22 mg/L, respectively) (p < 0.0001) or GG genotypes (2.88 ± 0.33, 2.45 ± 0.26 and 2.08 ± 0.16 mg/L, respectively) (p < 0.0001). Likewise, the mean 12-hour post-dose plasma nevirapine concentration in patients carrying TT genotype at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation (14.09 ± 9.49, 7.94 ± 2.76 and 9.44 ± 0.17 mg/L, respectively) tended to be higher than those carrying GT (5.65 ± 0.54, 5.58 ± 0.48 and 7.03 ± 0.64 mg/L, respectively) or GG genotypes (5.42 ± 0.48, 5.34 ± 0.50 and 6.43 ± 0.64 mg/L, respectively) (p = 0.003, p = 0.409 and p = 0.448, respectively). Compared with the effects of *CYP2B6-*516TT genotype, we could observe only small effects of rifampicin on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine levels. After 12 weeks of both drug regimens, there was a trend towards higher percentage of patients with *CYP2B6*-TT genotype who achieved HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL compared to those with GT or GG genotypes. This is the first report to demonstrate the effects of *CYP2B6 *G516T polymorphisms on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations when co-administered with rifampicin in HIV/TB co-infected Thai adults.\n\n### Conclusions\n\n*CYP2B6*-TT genotype had impact on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations, while rifampicin co-administration had only small effects.\n\n## Background\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals, accounting for more than 30% in Thailand, and up to 50% of them die during treatment [[1](#B1)]. The mortality is reduced in HIV-TB co-infected patients who have started the combination antiretroviral therapy after diagnosis of TB [[2](#B2)]. Concomitant administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and anti-TB medications is often complicated due to the drug-drug interaction and the adverse effect profile. Efavirenz and nevirapine based HAART regimens have mostly recommended to use as components of first-line antiretroviral drug regimens worldwide [[3](#B3)]. As efavirenz and nevirapine are potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), they are the preferable option for initial antiretroviral treatments (ART) in HIV/TB co-infection. Rifampicin is a critical component of TB therapy while it is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity [[4](#B4)]. The available pharmacokinetic data showed that rifampicin reduced the plasma concentration of efavirenz and nevirapine of 13-25% and 40%, respectively [[5](#B5)-[7](#B7)]. Recently, efavirenz was shown *in vitro *to be primarily metabolized by hepatic CYP2B6, with minor contributions from CYP3A4 and CYP2A6 [[4](#B4),[8](#B8)]. While rifampicin is an inducer of CYP3A4, nevirapine induces more CYP2B6 than CYP3A4 [[9](#B9)]. Nevirapine was also shown to be principally metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 [[10](#B10)]. *CYP2B6 *and *CYP3A4 *genotypes are evidenced to be associated with altered activity of hepatic enzyme in the liver and pharmacokinetics that may influence efficacy of treatment, since rifampicin causes decrease in efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations [[11](#B11)-[13](#B13)].\n\nThe *CYP2B6 *and *CYP3A4 *genes are highly polymorphic [[14](#B14)] and are subject to pronounce interindividual variability in expression and activity. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 516 on the *CYP2B6 *gene has been widely reported to play an important role in the metabolism of antiretroviral drugs [[15](#B15)-[18](#B18)]. This *CYP2B6 *genetic variant affects the efavirenz and nevirapine pharmacokinetics [[16](#B16),[19](#B19),[20](#B20)] and associated with clinical response to nevirapine-containing regimens in children [[16](#B16)]. Significant advances have led to a greater understanding of interactions between genetic and host factors that influence the efficacy and toxicity of efavirenz [[19](#B19),[21](#B21)]. However, the findings from one population may not be generalised to other populations due to the ethnic differences in drug effect and body weight of the patients. In Thailand, it has been recently reported that *CYP2B6*-G516T polymorphism significantly affected the drug metabolism of efavirenz in HIV-infected Thai children [[22](#B22)], while its impact on nevirapine concentrations was less pronounced after intra-partum single-dose nevirapine in HIV-infected mothers [[23](#B23)]. As efavirenz or nevirapine-based HAART is being used as the main therapy in Thailand, however, limited information was obtained so far among various Thai population regarding the influence of host genetic polymorphism on these drug levels especially nevirapine when co-administered with rifampicin which is essential for optimization of ARV dosage or drug-drug interaction. Therefore, the main objective of the present study is to investigate whether *CYP2B6 *and *CYP3A4 *polymorphisms could influence the plasma efavirenz and nevirapine levels when co-administered with rifampicin in HIV/TB infected Thai adults. The evaluation of clinical and immunological outcomes was also aimed.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Patients\n\nOne hundred and twenty four rifampicin recipients with concurrent HIV-1/TB coinfection were studied. Sixty-five of them received efavirenz (600 mg/day) based ART while 59 received nevirapine (400 mg/day) based ART. Initially, 142 patients were recruited for the study on a randomized control trial to compare the efficacy of efavirenz and nevirapine among HIV-infected patients receiving rifampicin at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute (BIDI), Nonthaburi since December 2006 [[24](#B24)]. They are ARV naïve with active tuberculosis and received rifampicin containing anti-TB regimens for 4-6 weeks prior to enrolment. The patients received oral lamivudine (150 mg) and stavudine (30 mg for those who weighed ≤ 60 kg and 40 mg for those who weighed >60 kg) every 12 hours. They were randomized to receive either efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime while fasting or nevirapine 200 mg every 12 hours after 2 weeks at a starting dose of 200 mg every 24 hours. The dosage of rifampicin was 450 mg/day for patients who weighed ≤ 50 kg and 600 mg/day for those who weighed >50 kg. The anti-TB drug regimen was isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide for the first two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for the subsequent 4-7 months. Among 142 patients recruited, 25 patients (9 in the efavirenz group and 16 in the nevirapine group) failed to continue the study because of hepatitis (2 cases in the nevirapine group), skin rash (3 in the efavirenz group and 2 in the nevirapine group), death (2 in the efavirenz group and 6 in the nevirapine group), transfer to the other hospital (1 in the nevirapine group), or lost to follow up (4 in the efavirenz group and 5 in the nevirapine group). In the present study, we analyzed 124 patients who have a complete data set of plasma drug levels at week 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation. The study was approved by Institutional Ethics Committees of Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute and the Ministry of Public Health, Thailand and the written informed consents were obtained from all participants.\n\n### Blood samples\n\nEDTA bloods were collected from patients for SNP genotyping, CD4 T cell counts and HIV-1 viral load. Lithium heparinized bloods were collected after 12 hours of drug administration (C_12_) at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and after rifampicin discontinuation for 1 month for analysis of plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations. The plasma were separated by centrifugation at 1800 g for 20 minutes and stored at -20°C.\n\n### SNP genotyping of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4\n\nThe genomic DNA was extracted by using QIAamp DNA blood Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and stored at -20°C for SNP genotyping. Genotyping of allelic variants in *CYP2B6 *and *CYP3A4 *were carried out by real-time PCR using the allelic-specific fluorogenic 5' nuclease chain reaction assay by ABI PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously [[15](#B15)]. Seven SNPs were genotyped: 4 SNPs of *CYP2B6*-G516T, -C777A, -A415G and -C1459T and 3 SNPs of *CYP3A4*-T566C, -T878C and C1088T. Each 25 μl PCR mixture contained 20 ng of genomic DNA, 900 nM primers, 200 nM TaqMan minor groove binder (MGB) probes and 12.5 μl TaqMan universal PCR master mix. The thermal cycler program was set up at 95°C for 10 minutes, and then repeated 40 cycles with 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. The plate was read by the allelic discrimination settings. The SNP assay was set up using SDS, version 1.3.0 as an absolute quantification assay. Post-assay analysis was done by using SDS software.\n\n### Determination of plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentration\n\nPlasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations were measured by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method at the HIV-Netherlands-Australia-Thailand (HIV-NAT) Research Pharmacokinetic Laboratory, Chulalongkorn Medical Research Center (Bangkok, Thailand). HPLC was performed in accordance with the protocol developed by Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Medical Center Nijmegan (Nijmegan, the Netherlands) [[25](#B25)].\n\n### CD4 T lymphocyte counts and plasma HIV-1 RNA quantitation\n\nThe CD4 T lymphocyte counts were done at baseline and every 12 weeks after initiation of antiretroviral treatment by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies with three colors reagent (TriTEST, Becton Dickinson BioSciences, USA) and analyzed by FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson BioSciences, USA.). Plasma HIV-1 RNA was determined by RT-PCR at baseline and every 12 weeks after initiation of ART and quantified using the COBAS Amplicor, version 1.5 (Roche Diagnostics, USA). The lower detection limit for HIV-1 RNA level is 50 copies/mL.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe different genotypes in relation to plasma drug levels were analysed by SPSS software version 14.0 (ID 5038562) (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). If unpaired one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was significant (p < 0.05), then post hoc Scheffe's *F *test was applied for multiple comparison. When plasma drug levels of different time points were compared, paired T test was used. The CD4 T cell counts and HIV-1 viral load in patients carrying different genotypes were compared by Kruskal-Wallis test. A difference in proportion of patients who achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml at week 12 of ART was evaluated by Chi square or Fisher's exact test. A *p *value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n## Results\n\n### Patient characteristics\n\nThe baseline characteristics of patients are shown in Table [1](#T1). All 124 patients were ethnically Thai and among these, 64.6% and 67.8% were male in efavirenz and nevirapine groups, respectively. The patients had the mean ages of 35.89 ± 8.17 and 38.03 ± 8.60 years and the mean body weights of 53.30 ± 9.79 and 54.39 ± 9.39 kg in efavirenz and nevirapine groups, respectively. Similar levels of laboratory parameters including alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin were seen in both patient groups. However, the levels of alkaline phosphatase among patients carrying TT genotype in efavirenz group were higher than those carrying GG or GT genotypes, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.085). The median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4 T lymphocyte counts were similar in both groups. In nevirapine treatment group, the log number of plasma HIV-1 viral load among patients carrying GG, GT and TT genotypes seem to be significantly different (p = 0.041).\n\n### Table 1.\n\n| Baseline characteristics | Efavirenz group (n = 65) |  |  |  | Nevirapine group (n = 59) |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | CYP2B6-G516T |  |  |  | CYP2B6-G516T |  |  |  |\n|   |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   | GG | GT | TT | p-value | GG | GT | TT | p-value |\n|   | n = 25 | n = 31 | n = 9 |   | n = 26 | n = 31 | n = 2 |   |\n| Sex Male: Female | 16: 9 | 21: 10 | 5: 4 | 0.795 | 17: 9 | 22: 9 | 1: 1 | 0.707 |\n| Ageyears, mean (SD) | 36.48(8.08) | 35.68(8.82) | 35(6.63) | 0.882 | 36.48(8.08) | 35.68(8.82) | 35(6.63) | 0.467 |\n| Body weightkg, mean (SD) | 52.9(1.87) | 53.94(1.89) | 52.22(3.04) | 0.872 | 54.62(2.06) | 54.7(1.52) | 46.5(6.5) | 0.489 |\n| Alkaline phosphatase,U/L, mean (SD) | 149.2(18.38) | 137.1(16.91) | 233.9(68.45) | 0.085 | 150.25(28.9) | 113.97(11.1) | 125(4) | 0.458 |\n| Aspartate aminotransferase U/L, mean (SD) | 32.8(2.35) | 40.48(3.32) | 43.22(10.21) | 0.202 | 48.54(7.31) | 35.58(2.99) | 26(1) | 0.167 |\n| Alanine aminotransferase, U/L, mean (SD) | 27.0(3.05) | 28.55(2.89) | 31.22(8.89) | 0.821 | 29.81(3.95) | 27.94(3.57) | 23.5(5.5) | 0.877 |\n| Total bilirubin,mg/dL, mean (SD) | 4.9(4.34) | 0.56(0.55) | 0.43(0.07) | 0.452 | 2.97(2.4) | 1.13(0.57) | 0.6(0.1) | 0.703 |\n| Direct bilirubin,mg/dL, mean (SD) | 0.45(0.14) | 0.37(0.12) | 0.21(0.05) | 0.631 | 0.28(0.047) | 0.52(0.199) | 0.30(0.1) | 0.568 |\n| CD4 count,cells/μl, median (IQR) | 41(18-102) | 54(24-120) | 67(12.5-168) | 0.818 | 35.5(23.5-97) | 45(25-113) | 30.5(23) | 0.595 |\n| Log Plasma HIV-1 viral loadmedian (IQR) | 5.90(5.57-6.0) | 5.93(5.39-6.0) | 5.64(5.50-6.0) | 0.729 | 5.86(5.46-6.0) | 5.60(5.41-5.81) | 5.80(Q1 = 5.59) | 0.041* |\n\nTable 1 Caption: Baseline characteristics of 124 HIV/TB co-infected patients with CYP2B6-G516T genotypes in efavirenz and nevirapine groups.\n\n### Frequencies of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 genetic polymorphisms\n\nSeven SNPs: 4 SNPs of *CYP2B6*- G516T, -C777A, -A415G and -C1459T and 3 SNPs of *CYP3A4*-T566C, -T878C and -C1088T were genotyped. For *CYP2B6-*G516T, 38.46% (25/65) of GG genotype (wild-type), 47.69% (31/65) of GT genotype (heterozygous mutant) and 13.85% (9/65) of TT genotype (homozygous mutant) were found among patients in efavirenz group, while in nevirapine group, there were 44.07% (26/59) of *CYP2B6*-516GG genotype, 52.54% (31/59) of GT genotype and 3.39% (2/59) of TT genotype. The genotype frequencies of *CYP2B6*-C777A and -A415G in efavirenz and nevirapine groups were 100% of homozygous mutant AA and 100% of homozygous wild-type AA, respectively. For *CYP2B6*-C1459T, there were 98.5% (64/65) of CC homozygous wild-type and 1.5% (1/65) of CT heterozygous mutant in efavirenz group, and 91.5% (54/59) of CC homozygous wild-type, 6.8% (4/59) of CT heterozygous mutant and 1.7% (1/59) homozygous mutant in nevirapine group. Likewise, the genotype frequencies in *CYP3A4*-T566C and -C1088T were 100% of homozygous wild-type TT and homozygous mutant TT, respectively, in both efavirenz and nevirapine groups. For *CYP3A4*-T878C, there were 95.4% (62/65) of homozygous TT and 4.6% (3/65) of heterozygous TC, and 98.3% (58/59) of homozygous TT and 1.69% (1/59) of heterozygous TC in efavirenz and nevirapine groups, respectively.\n\n### CYP2B6-G516T and CYP3A4-T878C genetic polymorphisms and plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations\n\nAmong 4 SNPs of *CYP2B6*-G516T, -C777A, -A415G and -C1459T being evaluated, the frequencies of wild-type, heterozygous mutant and homozygous mutant were well distributed only in *CYP2B6-*G516T polymorphism, therefore, the analysis of this gene polymorphism was further done in relation to plasma efavirenz and nevirapine levels. The mean plasma efavirenz concentration in patients with homozygous TT genotype at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation (10.97 ± 2.32, 13.62 ± 4.21 mg/L and 8.48 ± 1.30 mg/L, respectively) were significantly higher than those with GT genotype (3.43 ± 0.29, 3.35 ± 0.27 mg/L and 3.21 ± 0.22 mg/L, respectively) or GG genotype (2.88 ± 0.33, 2.45 ± 0.26 and 2.08 ± 0.16 mg/L, respectively) (p < 0.0001) (Figure [1a, b, c](#F1)). Similar results were found in nevirapine group (Figure [1d, e, f](#F1)) in that the mean plasma drug concentration of patients with TT genotype at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation (14.09 ± 9.49, 7.94 ± 2.76 and 9.44 ± 0.17 mg/L, respectively) tended to be higher than those with GT genotype (5.65 ± 0.54, 5.58 ± 0.48 and 7.03 ± 0.64 mg/L, respectively) or GG genotype (5.42 ± 0.48, 5.34 ± 0.50 and 6.43 ± 0.64 mg/L, respectively) (p = 0.003, p = 0.409 and p = 0.448, respectively).\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/36a2/2859392/caf3ce4047cf/1742-6405-7-8-1.jpg)\n\nMean plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations in HIV/TB adults with different genotypes of CYP2B6-G516T polymorphism. The scatter diagram of plasma efavirenz (Fig.1a, b, c) and nevirapine distribution (Fig. 1d, e, f) at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation. The numbers of GG, GT and TT genotype patients were 25, 31 and 9 in efavirenz group and 26, 31, 2 in nevirapine group.\n\nOne month after rifampicin discontinuation, there was a clear trend towards lower plasma efavirenz levels than those during concomitant rifampicin at week 6 and 12 of ART regardless of *CYP2B6 *G516T genotypes. In fact, when we evaluated effects of rifampicin on plasma efavirenz levels without stratifying *CYP2B6 *G516T polymorphisms, the plasma efavirenz levels after rifampicin discontinuation (3.5 ± 2.67 mg/L) were significantly lower than those at week 6 (4.26 ± 3.96 mg/L) (p = 0.043) and tended to be lower than those at week 12 (4.42 ± 5.97 mg/L) (p = 0.133). In contrast, plasma nevirapine levels at 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation (6.84 ± 3.4 mg/L) were significantly higher than those at week 6 (5.83 ± 3.6 mg/L, p = 0.034) and those at week 12 (5.56 ± 2.63 mg/L, p < 0.001). The reason for these discrepant results on effects of rifampicin on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine levels is not clear at present. Further studies including evaluation of plasma drug levels at time points other than 12-hour post-dose would be thus necessary. Nevertheless, we at least can conclude that the magnitude of effects on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine levels by rifampicin was much smaller than that by *CYP2B6 *516 TT genotype.\n\nWith respect to *CYP3A4*, the analysis was done in only *CYP3A4-*T878C, since there was no variation at the *CYP3A4*-T878C and -C1088T in our study subjects. The results showed that the mean plasma efavirenz concentration at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation were 4.00 ± 0.42, 4.20 ± 0.72 and 3.48 ± 0.34 mg/L, respectively, in patients with homozygous TT genotype and 9.62 ± 6.35, 8.97 ± 6.33 and 3.87 ± 1.69 mg/L, respectively, in those with heterozygous TC genotype. Similarly, the mean plasma nevirapine concentration at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation were 5.85 ± 0.48, 5.50 ± 0.34 and 6.80 ± 0.45 mg/L, respectively, in patients with homozygous TT genotype, and 4.8, 8.69 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively, in one patient with heterozygous mutant TC genotype. Although there was a trend towards higher plasma drug levels in patients with heterozygous mutant TC genotype, appropriate statistical evaluation of this difference was difficult due to small numbers of heterozygous mutant TC.\n\n### CD4 T cell counts and HIV-1 viral load among patients with CYP2B6-G516T genotypes\n\nThe CD4 T cell counts among patients carrying different *CYP2B6 *genotypes in efavirenz and nevirapine groups are shown in Figure [2](#F2). The number of CD4 T cells in patients with TT, GT and GG genotypes increased in a similar manner at all time points at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 of ART compared to the baseline in both efavirenz and nevirapine groups. No significant difference in median CD4 T cell counts of each genotype at different time points was seen in efavirenz group (p = 0.818, 0.838, 0.783, 0.753 and 0.587 for baseline, weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 of ART, respectively), whereas, in nevirapine group, the median CD4 T cell counts of patients with TT genotype seem to be lower than those with the other two genotypes at different time points, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.595, 0.182, 0.554, 0.573 and 0.494, respectively) (Figure [2a, b](#F2)).\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/36a2/2859392/1beef34fed68/1742-6405-7-8-2.jpg)\n\nMedian CD4 T cell counts among HIV/TB adults with CYP2B6-G516T polymorphism at different time points. (Black diamond) GG genotype, (Black square), GT genotype, (Black triangle) TT genotype in efavirenz (a) and nevirapine groups (b) at baseline, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks of ART.\n\nAs shown in Table [2](#T2), when the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA level <50 copies/mL (log 1.69) were compared among *CYP2B6*-G516T genotypes at week 12 of ART, 88.89% (8/9) of patients with TT genotype in efavirenz group could achieve the HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL, which were higher than those with GT genotype (77.42%, 24/31) and GG genotype (68%, 17/25), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.430). Similarly, in nevirapine group, 100% (2/2) of those with TT genotype, 70.97% (23/31) of those with GT genotype and 60% (15/26) of those with GG genotype could achieve the HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL, but this difference also did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.288) due to small numbers of patients with homozygous TT genotype in this study. At weeks 24, 36 and 48 of ART, nearly all the patients achieved undetectable viral load, since viral load were not detected in 95.38% (62/65), 93.65% (59/63) and 87.9% (54/62), respectively, of efavirenz group and 96.55% (56/58), 94.64% (53/56) and 94.64% (53/56), respectively, of nevirapine group.\n\n### Table 2.\n\n|   | Efavirenz group (N = 65) |  |  |  | Nevirapine group (N = 59) |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   | CYP2B6-G516T |  |  |  | CYP2B6-G516T |  |  |  |\n|   |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|   | GGn = 25 | GTn = 31 | TTn = 9 | p-value* | GGn = 26 | GTn = 31 | TTn = 2 | p-value** |\n| No. of patients(%) | 17(68) | 24(77.42) | 8(88.89) | 0.430 | 15(60) | 23(70.97) | 2(100) | 0.288 |\n\nTable 2 Caption: Number of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml at week 12 of ART.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis is the first report to demonstrate the effects of *CYP2B6*-G516T and *CYP3A4-*T878C polymorphisms on plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations in rifampicin-treated HIV/TB co-infected Thai adults. The results indicated that the wide interindividual variability of efavirenz concentrations is strongly influenced by *CYP2B6-*516TT genotype by the finding of significantly higher plasma efavirenz concentration at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation compared to those with GT or GG genotype. Likewise, it seems to be that this *CYP2B6-*516TT would also influence nevirapine concentrations, although it was less pronounced probably due to the small samples size of homozygous mutant TT in our sample set. The present results were in line with the previous report on efavirenz pharmacokinetics when co-administration with rifampicin in HIV/TB co-infected Indian [[26](#B26),[27](#B27)] and Ghana patients [[28](#B28)] in that plasma efavirenz was highest in patients with *CYP2B6*-516TT genotype when compared to those with GT or GG genotypes. While the heterozygous TC mutant in *CYP3A4-*T878C in this study seems to have some effects on plasma drug concentrations in patients at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and 1 month after rifampicin discontinuation in both efavirenz and nevirapine groups, further statistical analysis was not done due to the relatively less variation of *CYP3A4 *among Thai adults in this study. Further investigation should include a larger sample size with varying genotypes in order to draw a definite conclusion on the effect of *CYP3A4 *variations.\n\nIn this study, the frequency of *CYP2B6*-G516T among 124 Thai adults was 8.9%, which was close to that of our recent study on 237 HIV-infected Thai adults with different rate of CD4 T cell recovery after ARV treatment (9.7%) (submitted for publication) and slightly lower than what has been reported in Thai children (11%) [[22](#B22)]. Comparing to the other ethnic groups, it was higher than those of Japanese (3.3%) [[15](#B15)] and Caucasian (6%) [[14](#B14)], but lower than that of African-American (20%) [[21](#B21)] or African population (23%) [[28](#B28),[29](#B29)]. Although the frequencies of *CYP2B6*-G516T were different among populations or ethnicity, the pharmacogenetic studies reported so far in HIV patients demonstrated that *CYP2B6 *516TT was definitely associated with plasma efavirenz concentration [[15](#B15),[19](#B19),[21](#B21),[29](#B29),[30](#B30)]. The findings of *CYP2B6 *516TT genotype in the present study support its effect on plasma efavirenz concentration in different ethnic group and gave additional information of this SNP on nevirapine based-ART when co-administered with rifampicin. The recent pharmacogenetic study in HIV patients co-administrated with efavirenz and rifampicin demonstrated that patients carrying TT genotype had significantly higher mean plasma efavirenz but lower oral clearance [[28](#B28)], indicating that rifampicin does not fully reverse the poor metabolizer phenotype and that TT genotype can be used to identify poor metabolizers of efavirenz even in patients co-administrated with rifampicin. Consistently, the present results also indicated that rifampicin coadministration in HIV/TB infected patients did not significantly alter plasma efavirenz and nevirapine levels in patients with TT genotype (p > 0.05). Other possible factors that might affect the plasma drug levels could be excluded since they were carefully controlled.\n\nAlthough rifampicin can cause the decrease in NNRTI concentrations, the mean plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations in all studied patients with TT, GT and GG genotypes had plasma drug levels above the minimum recommendation (1 mg/L for efavirenz and 3.4 mg/L for nevirapine). One important conclusion from our recent prospective and randomized clinical trial in patients with concurrent HIV/TB receiving rifampicin [[24](#B24)] is that the standard dosage of efavirenz 600 mg or nevirapine 400 mg per day and co-administration with rifampicin was adequate for HIV-1 suppression, however, variation in the plasma drug levels in some patients were found, which might be due to the genetic variations among individuals. Although we reported recently that high body weights of the patients were associated with a low efavirenz C_12 _at weeks 6 and 12 of ART [[31](#B31)], the present results demonstrated that the body weights did not differ among patients with different genotypes of *CYP2B6 *G516T polymorphism. The present results thus demonstrated that rifampicin has very small effects on efavirenz and nevirapine plasma drug. The advantage of our present study over previous studies is that plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations during co-administration of rifampicin could be compared with those without rifampicin after completing TB drug treatment.\n\nIn general, the high plasma efavirenz and nevirapine levels could lead to the adverse effect such as rash, hepatitis, and neuropsychological toxicity [[32](#B32),[33](#B33)]. In order to reduce such adverse effects, several studies attempted to test the feasibility of genotype-based dose reduction of efavirenz in African-American [[34](#B34)] and Japanese HIV infected patients [[35](#B35)] and showed that efavirenz dose reduction is feasible and can reduce efavirenz-associated central nervous system symptoms in homozygotes of *CYP2B6-*G516T. Although patients with *CYP2B6-*516TT in our cohort had obviously high plasma efavirenz levels at all time points and certain degree of central nervous system and psychiatric manifestations, they were all well tolerated with the adverse effects. The adverse drug events have not recorded in nevirapine based treatment probably due to the limited number of patients with homozygous TT. Since there were 7 cases who could not complete the study due to side effects [[24](#B24)] it is necessary to determine *CYP2B6 *G516T genotypes of these individuals in order to know whether *CYP2B6-*516TT homozygote in Thailand were all well tolerated with the adverse effects of efavirenz and nevirapine.\n\nWith respect to possible correlation of the variations in plasma efavirenz and nevirapine levels with the treatment outcome, our results indicated that the patients with *CYP2B6 *516TT genotype had a higher frequency of viral load suppression at week 12 of ART than those with GT and GG genotype. The CD4 T cell counts increased after treatment at all time points which were correlated with HIV-1 viral load reduction. When the effect of different *CYP2B6-*G516T genotypes was analysed, no difference was observed among patients with TT, GT and GG genotypes in both efavirenz and nevirapine groups. Collectively, it is indicated that the efavirenz and nevirapine-based ART co-administered with rifampicin are well correlated with virological and immunological outcomes in patients undergoing treatment for HIV and TB.\n\nIn summary, the *CYP2B6 *and *CYP3A4 *polymorphisms were analysed, for the first time, in HIV/TB co-infected Thai adults receiving efavirenz and nevirapine based-ART co-administered with rifampicin and the results indicated that only 516G>T in *CYP2B6 *gene, but not *CYP3A4 *gene polymorphism, gave the significant effects on plasma drug levels. Only small effects of rifampicin on efavirenz and nevirapine plasma concentration were observed. However, for further investigation, other SNPs such as *CYP2B6 *T983C or TGATC-*CYP2B6 *haplotypes which were shown to influence the NNRTI plasma drug levels [[23](#B23),[36](#B36),[37](#B37)] should be taken into account and larger sample size with varying genotypes should be included.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n*CYP2B6*-TT genotype had effects on both the plasma efavirenz and nevirapine concentrations in HIV/TB patients when co-administered with rifampicin. The information might be useful for better treatment of patients with HIV or HIV/TB.\n\n## Competing interests\n\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n## Authors' contributions\n\nSU, SL, WM, NW, TK, SK participated in the study design.

Despite these beneficial features of NNRTIs, which significantly improves the prognosis and quality of life of people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV), some PLHIV with ARV develop severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs), especially drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The reported incidence of ARVDILI can range from 8 to 23% of PLHIV; nevertheless, up to 30% of these PLHIV require a change of regimen or treatment discontinuation, which subsequently causes prolonged hospitalization, in which severe cases will be fatal^2–5^, If not detected and treated promptly, it may potentially cause severe hepatitis and even death in some PLHIV^6,7^.\n\nNevirapine (NVP) is the NNRTI used in countless PLHIV due to its proven efficacy, advantageous metabolic profile, cost-effectiveness, and particularly its significance in strategies aimed at simplifying combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)^8–10^. Unfortunately, approximately 6–17% of NVP recipients experienced ARVDILI, with up to 12% developing severe ARVDILI^11–14^. In terms of its biological metabolism, cytochrome P450 primarily facilitates the biological metabolism of NVP, resulting in the formation of four mono-oxygenated metabolites. 12-OH-NVP, a byproduct of CYP, has reportedly been associated with the development of rash, which may play a role in hepatic toxicity^15^. In addition to NVP, Efavirenz (EFV), one of the NNRTIs, is used in numerous successful first-line HIV regimens. However, efficacy, tolerability, and availability made it an exception for certain PLHIV^16^. Unfortunately, EFV administration was associated with ARVDILI. Drug accumulation in the liver was considered the perpetrator^17^. To increase their safety, it is essential to fill the gap in knowledge about NNRTIs’ effects on the liver and their role in DILI development^18^. Interestingly, genetics has been hypothesized as one of the critical contributors to ARVDILI pathogenesis in several populations^19^.\n\nAccording to several findings from previous studies as a putative mediator for liver disease in PLHIV, *CYP2B6* is the most promising of numerous intriguing genes associated with ARVDILI. It is responsible for several drugs metabolism and synthesizing cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids^20^. Interestingly, CYP2B6 enzymes are also the primary metabolizers of nevirapine and efavirenz. In all investigated populations, *CYP2B6*6* is the most common variant allele^20^. *CYP2B6*6* haplotype is characterized by the existence of two variants, G516T (rs3745274) and A785G (rs2279343), with or without promoter variants^21^. This allele has been associated with a 50–75% decrease in CYP2B6 enzyme levels but not with the protein’s active or substrate recognition sites^22–24^. In that context, a decrease in protein level might help explain why *CYP2B6*6* was associated with an increased risk of ARVDILI from efavirenz^25^ and nevirapine^26^. In contrast to the above findings, other previous studies^13,27,28^ unveiled no correlation between *CYP2B6*6* polymorphisms and susceptibility to ARVDILI due to efavirenz as well as nevirapine. To clarify the above associations, a meta-analysis, a valuable tool for deriving meaningful conclusions from data and for resolving inconsistencies found in research, is needed.\n\nAccordingly, the objectives of this study were to summarize and analyze existing data on pharmacogenomics associated with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors drug-induced liver injury using systematic review and meta-analysis approaches along with network analysis to gain insight into molecular interactions of these pharmacogenes and their genetic polymorphisms associations with ARVDILI.\n\n## Results\n\n### A systematic review of genetic polymorphisms associated with ARVDILI\n\nEight hundred forty-one publications were collected from PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases using the search terms specified in methodologies. After data refinement using exclusion criteria, 165 duplicated publications were removed. In addition, 377 publications were excluded due to unrelated topics, 247 were not primary sources of data, 2 were studies in vitro and in silico models, and one was published in a language other than English. In the end, 50 different papers were considered for inclusion in this study.\n\nHowever, 39 publications reported on associations of genetic polymorphisms with ARVDILI. The top-fifth of the highest number of reports were 11 for *UGT1A1*, 11 for *CYP2B6*, four reports of *ABCB1*, two for *HLA-Cw*, and two for *HLA-DRB1* (Figure [S1](#MOESM1)). The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of collected ARVDILI-associated genes depicted interactions among several genes. In the pathway collected by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), alternative findings from a PPI network showed that the network is functionally enriched in the metabolism of xenobiotics^29^. The results illustrated that the ARVDILI was primarily involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Interestingly, the STRING database indicates that CYP2D6, CYP1A1, and CYP2B6 seem to be the center of the interaction among those proteins (Figure S2). In PPI analysis, CYP2B6 was selected as a candidate gene due to its frequent reports and centrality. From this, *CYP2B6* genetic polymorphisms were further analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis approach.\n\n### Meta-analysis of CYP2B6 associated with efavirenz-induced liver injury\n\n#### Study selection and characteristics\n\nThe selection process is registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024593948) and illustrated in Fig. [1](#Fig1). Initially, 350 publications were included in this study. Publications were initially included for publication appraisal. Following the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for case-control and cohort study, three publications with 106 cases of ARVDILI from a total of 795 PLHIV were selected. The publication years ranged from 2011 to 2012, as described in Table [1](#Tab1). All the studies were conducted on the African population. There were two cohort studies and one case-control study.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ca1e/11603346/4711ad5d6b9e/41598_2024_79965_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=11603346_41598_2024_79965_Fig1_HTML.jpg)\n\nFlow diagram of this meta-analysis of CYP2B6 association with EFV-induced liver injury.

The findings of the study indicated that the sensitivity test for the meta-analysis of *CYP2B6* genotypes was successfully completed. Heterogeneity had not been noticed. A funnel plot was utilized in order to analyze publication bias. The condensed plot that is provided at the top of the 95% confidence interval triangle reveals publication bias for studies that had a large number of PLHIV participants, as shown by the funnel plots. But the plots were symmetrical between the sides of the triangle, which showed that there was no publication bias observed for either negative or positive results (Figure S3).\n\n### Meta-analysis of CYP2B6 associated with nevirapine-induced liver injury\n\n#### Study selection and characteristics\n\nThe selection process is registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024593948) and demonstrated in Fig. [3](#Fig3). To begin, 356 publications were included for selection. Then, due to duplication, 49 publications were removed. Following that, 307 publications were screened, with 305 excluded from the analysis; most studies fulfilled the exclusion criteria, while some lacked eligible data for analysis. Finally, two publications were included for the appraisal (Supplementary Table [S1](#MOESM1)), including 38 ARVDILI and 782 non-ARVDILI PLHIV (Table [1](#Tab1)).\n\n![Fig. 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ca1e/11603346/75e5d4108bf0/41598_2024_79965_Fig3_HTML.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=11603346_41598_2024_79965_Fig3_HTML.jpg)\n\nFlow diagram of this meta-analysis of CYP2B6 association with NVP-induced liver injury.

Meta-analysis showed that *CYP2B6 *1/*6* allele and combination of **1/*6* + **6/*6* alleles were significantly associated with a reduction in susceptibility to NVP-induced liver injury, compared with normal metabolizer (Fig. [4](#Fig4)), with pooled OR and 95% CI of 0.44 (0.22–0.91) and 0.42 (0.21–0.84), respectively, as well as *P* value less than 0.05 (Table [2](#Tab2)). However, there was no significant association between *CYP2B6* homozygous **6* with ARVDILI risk (Fig. [4](#Fig4)).\n\n![Fig. 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ca1e/11603346/6834e6112493/41598_2024_79965_Fig4_HTML.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=11603346_41598_2024_79965_Fig4_HTML.jpg)\n\nForest plot comparison between CYP2B6 variance and wild-type and the susceptibility of NVP-induced liver injury from 2 publications. CI, confidential interval.\n\n#### Sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias analyses\n\nAccording to the results of the sensitivity analysis, the substantial relationships between the *CYP2B6 *1/*6* allele and a combination of **1*/**6* + **6*/**6* alleles with a lower risk of NVP-induced liver injury were not attributable to chance. Heterogeneity had not been noticed. An investigation on publication bias was carried out utilizing a funnel plot, which revealed that publication bias was not discovered for either a negative or positive result (Figure S4).\n\n## Discussion\n\nRecently, genetic polymorphisms associated with ARVDILI have been studied, increasing the possibility of utilizing them as biomarkers to predict the chance of developing ARVDILI^28^. Consistent with this, our systematic review showed numerous reports on the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and ARVDILI in several populations. The fifth highest frequency of reported gene-associated ARVDILI was *UGT1A1*, *CYP2B6*, *ABCB1*, *HLA-Cw*04*, and *HLA-DRB1*, respectively.\n\nAdditionally, the PPI analysis illustrated the functional enrichment of the protein in the network involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The results suggested that the ARVDILI was mainly affected by the function of xenobiotic metabolisms. In addition, PPI network analysis of these gene-encoded proteins demonstrated links between those proteins with CYP1A1 and CYP2B6 as central to their interactions. The result demonstrated the association of CYP1A1 and CYP2B6 proteins with other proteins in the network. Due to the centrality in the PPI network and reports frequency, the CYP2B6 protein has been hypothesized to be the crucial molecule.\n\nConsequently, based on this premise, we conducted meta-analyses to verify the relationship between *CYP2B6* polymorphisms and their association with ARVDILI susceptibility. Our findings demonstrated that a genotype known as *CYP2B6*6*, which is related with a decreased ability to metabolize drugs, was linked to an increased risk of ARVDILI in PLHIV patients who were using EFV. Conversely, the mentioned genotype is also associated with a reduced risk in nevirapine-administered PLHIV.\n\nCYP2B6 is the drug-metabolizing enzyme involved in EFV and NVP metabolisms, especially EFV. Plentiful evidence obtained from hepatocyte experiments uncovered that EFV compromised cell viability and altered mitochondrial function by diminishing mitochondrial membrane potential, decreasing mitochondrial O_2_ consumption, and increasing ROS production^30–33^. In addition to EFV, 8-hydroxyefavirenz (8-OH-EFV), the primary metabolite of EFV, generally has the capability to induce cell death and ROS production in hepatocytes^34^. Therefore, the EFV and its primary metabolite are the reactive forms that can cause ARVDILI in PLHIV. In addition, according to a previous study, the CYP2B6 enzyme metabolizes EFV into 8-OH-EFV, then 8,14-diOHEFV, respectively^35^. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the poor metabolizer form of the CYP2B6 enzyme, such as *6, has been linked to ARVDILI in several populations.\n\nOn the contrary, in NVP’s circumstance, the meta-analysis results showed that *CYP2B6* *1/*6 and a combination of *1/*6 and *6/*6 were dominantly found in the controls group, thus indicating that the poor metabolizer form of CYP2B6 may reduce the risk of ARVDILI. In contrast to this result, the LiverTox database and a previous study by Ciccacci et al. both depicted that the CYP2B6 inducer produced a toxic intermediate and subsequently caused DILI in PLHIV^36,37^. This contradictory result may be explained by the fact that NVP has several metabolizing enzymes and numerous metabolites, resulting in the production of 2-, 3-, 8-, and 12-hydroxynevirapine (-OH-NVP) and 4-carboxynevirapine. Unlike EFV, the active metabolite produced by CYP2B6, 8-OH-NVP, is not the most abundant metabolite. Moreover, the major metabolite of NVP produced by CYP3A4, 12-OH-NVP^38^, has been implicated in hepatotoxicity and skin rash caused by NVP^15,39,40^. Therefore, to draw a clear explanation of the association between *CYP2B6* polymorphisms and hepatotoxicity in NVP-administered PLHIV, the genotypic information of *CYP3A4* is required. This discrepancies between EFV and NVP results may cause different interpretation of *CYP2B6* genotyping results between two medication users. While poor metabolizer of CYP2B6 may cause DILI in EFV using PLHIV and should decide the regimen alteration, NVP using PLHIV may continue without any interaction. However, due to the limited number of publications and sample size, another study on this topic is encouraged to identify the exact reason for conflicting results.\n\nThe CYP2B6 enzyme is not the exclusive metabolizer of EFV and NVP^41^. UGTs, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1A2, and CYP2A6 may have minimal contributory roles in the xenometabolic phase of EFV^22,42–44^. CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 are also involved in the metabolism of NVP^45–47^. Consequently, the influence of several genes on ARVDILI susceptibility seems inescapable. Chanhom et al. observed the effects of various genes in ATDILI within the Thai population^48^. This finding also indicates the potential for various gene association studies in ARVDILI. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to investigate the specific interactions between these genes and ARVDILI susceptibility, especially in diverse populations. Understanding the role of genetic variations in drug metabolism can help improve personalized medicine and reduce the risk of adverse reactions. Overall, the complex interplay between genes and DILI underscores the importance of pharmacogenomics in optimizing patient care.\n\nNoteworthy, some inherent limitations need to be considered when evaluating the presented findings. First, we included publications published only in English; thus, language bias was unavoidable. Accordingly, we lost reports published in other languages, possibly leading to selection bias. Moreover, we performed a PPI analysis to investigate the potential of the protein/gene for further meta-analysis. However, the PPI function is quite restricted and cannot be confirmed by clinical outcomes. The authors encouraged further bioinformatic study to investigate the interplay among genes, proteins, and clinical outcomes in ARVDILI. Moreover, one of the possible confounders was DILI definition due to the change of the definition in 2016^49^ which may affect the DILI interpretation discrepancies between studies. The author encouraged further observational studies or trials to comply with the updated RUCAM criteria for DILI causality assessment^49^. Along with this, some publications were excluded due to our rigid selection protocol, which might be the possible reason for sparse publications and sample sizes and could cause inconsistent results, especially in NVP-induced liver injury. Furthermore, the limited number of publications and sample size in this meta-analysis adversely affects the generalizability of its conclusions. The meta-analysis of the link between *CYP2B6* genotypes and EFV-induced liver injury was only derived from the African population, as well as NVP-induced liver injury were obtained from only African and Caucasian populations. Consequently, referencing this may produce divergent outcomes in other populations with varying polymorphism frequencies. Contrastingly, this meta-analysis highlights the research deficit in different populations, and a rigid selection protocol might construct an exceptional foundation for future studies. For this reason, we might mitigate the effect of the confounding factors, which provide us with more precise analysis results. Notably, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the association between *CYP2B6* polymorphisms and ARVDILI in PLHIV.\n\nIn conclusion, our systematic review illustrated that *UGT1A1*, *CYP2B6*, and *ABCB1* were the most frequently studied genes. This meta-analysis illustrated that *CYP2B6 *6* and *1 was significantly associated with EFV-induced liver injury and NVP-induced liver injury in PLHIV, respectively. Additionally, the results of this study may use as a fundamental knowledge to develop decision support guideline for drug selection and personalized medicine for PLHIV in the near future. Further observational studies with larger sample size, well-characterized subjects, and various ethnicities are warranted to gain a precise conclusion and develop those polymorphisms as genetic markers for predicting PLHIV with a high ARVDILI risk induced by EFV and NVP.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Gene associated with ARVDILI exploration\n\nScopus and PubMed were combed using the following search terminology. ((“ARV” OR “Antiretroviral treatment” OR “antiretroviral agent*” OR “Antiretroviral drug*\"OR “Anti-HIV Agent*” OR “HIV therapy” OR “HIV treatment” OR “HAART” OR “NNRTI*” OR “nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors”) AND (“genetic polymorphism*” OR “polymorphism*” OR “Pharmacogenetic*” OR “Immunogenetic*” OR “Pharmacogenomic*” OR “genome wide association study” OR “variant allele*” OR “genetic predisposition” OR “Gene Variant*”)) AND (“ARV-associated hepatotoxicity” OR “drug-induced hepatotoxic” OR “Drug-induced hepatotoxicity” OR “Hepatotoxic” OR “Hepatotoxicity” OR “Liver toxicity” OR “Liver toxic” OR “drug-induced liver injury” OR “DILI” OR “liver injury” OR “Drug induced hepatitis” OR “Drug-induced hepatitis” OR “Hepatitis” OR “hypersensitivity reaction” OR “hypersensitivity*” OR “hyperbilirubinemia”). From inception to 1 August 2023, original research articles on the association between genetic polymorphisms and ARVDILI were gathered. The studies with negative results were exclusively excluded from the analysis. Frequencies of association reports of each gene-ATDILI association were reported. Proteins associated with ARVs were analyzed using STRING online software version 11.5 ([https://string-db.org/](https://string-db.org/))^50^. The STRING integrated and classified protein/gene associations by benchmarking them in experimental and predicted physical/theoretical protein-protein interactions data. By the criteria of the STRING standard, the interaction network was deemed to have a confidence score of more than 0.70, and all interaction sources were selected, including text-mining, experiment, databases, co-expression, neighborhood, gene fusion, and co-occurrence. Each protein was represented as a node in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and an interaction between two proteins in the network was denoted by an edge. These interactions might either be physical or theoretical.\n\n### Meta-analysis of CYP2B6 associated with efavirenz/nevirapine-induced liver injury\n\n#### Search strategies of the literature for meta-analysis\n\nOn 10 October 2024, the original publication search was performed using electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The PICO strategy was used throughout the search process^51^. Following is the definition of the PICO: Population (P): PLHIV who receive efavirenz or nevirapine medication, Intervention (I): *CYP2B6* genotype associated with an increased risk of ARVDILI in PLHIV, Comparator (C): *CYP2B6* normal metabolizer, and Outcomes (O): hepatotoxicity. The search techniques were developed by combining several search phrases with various Boolean operators^52^.\n\n#### The process of selecting studies for meta-analyses\n\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) the study subjects were PLHIV receiving EFV or NVP; (ii) the study investigated the association between *CYP2B6* polymorphisms and ARVDILI susceptibility; and (iii) the study was a randomized controlled trial, cohort, or case-control design. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) the study was either a case report secondary or tertiary publication such as a review, systematic review, and meta-analysis, (ii) the study was conducted in an animal model, in vitro, or in silico, iv) full article cannot be accessed, (iii) the study was not published in English, (iv) the study did not observe the liver function test, (v) the study included confounding factors such as viral hepatitis infection, alcoholism, or concomitant hepatotoxic medication, (vi) the study included vulnerable subjects such as children, pregnant/breastfeeding women, or elderly, (vii) the study is unrelated to the association between at *CYP2B6* polymorphisms and ARVDILI susceptibility or does not have sufficient data for analysis.\n\n#### Assessment of selected study quality\n\nThe Newcastle-Ottawa scale was utilized by two reviewers, JS and JI, in order to conduct independent evaluations of the articles’ overall quality^53^. The issue that existed between the two reviewers was finally settled by conversation and agreement with the third reviewer (NC). The scores on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale range from 0 to 9, with 0 being the lowest and 9 being the highest. If the publication’s overall evaluation score was higher than 6, then it was determined that the publication successfully passed the evaluation (Supplementary Table 1). The studies were grouped according to the medication involved in the study, i.e., either the NVP group or the EFV group.\n\n#### Data extraction for meta-analysis\n\nThe information from each of the research that were considered to be relevant was compiled into a single sheet of data. The following information was taken from the article: first author, publication year, study design, ethnicity, sample size, gender, age, BMI, observed medication, DILI definition and the number of ARVDILI/non-ARVDILI for each *CYP2B6* genotype along with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. In the event where two of the reviewers, JS and JI, could not come to an agreement regarding the findings of the data extraction, the issue was settled through discussion and by reaching a consensus with the third reviewer (NC).\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nMeta-analysis of *CYP2B6* gene effect sizes was conducted using Computer program Review Manager (RevMan^®^). Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, the Cochrane Collaboration, 2014. In accordance with low heterogeneity among studies and similarity of population and study design, The Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effects model was used to calculate pooled OR, 95% CI, and P-value^54^. In order to be declared statistically significant, the P-value has to be lower than 0.05. The Chi-square test or an I^2^ value of more than 50% were utilized to make an approximation of the heterogeneity that existed among the studies^55^. The results of the individual research and the synthesis were plotted out in the forest plot so that they could be viewed visually. A funnel plot was then used to establish whether or not there was any publishing bias.\n\n## Electronic supplementary material\n\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis research project has been funded by Mahidol University (Fundamental Fund: fiscal year 2024 by National Science Research and Innovation Fund (NSRF))The authors want to thank the Faculty of Pharmacy, Mahidol University, for providing access to the databases and the authors of the original articles for providing useful information.

It is classified into two large groups, according to the cell of origin. 85% of the cases correspond to ALL with B cell precursors and 15% with T cell [2](#B2) ^,^ [3](#B3). It occurs more frequently in children with Hispanic and Caucasian ancestry than in those of African ancestry [4](#B4) ^,^ [5](#B5). A few environmental risk factors have been associated with ALL in children (exposure to radiation and certain chemicals); however, these associations explain only a minority of cases [6](#B6).\n\nOne of the major milestones in the therapy of children with ALL was the development of an intensive regimen of 8 drugs, eight weeks of induction and consolidation, which formed the basis of the BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster) regimen, which is the backbone of current therapies for ALL. In addition, the chemotherapy strategy also includes intensification and maintenance therapy [6](#B6). Since the introduction of this therapeutic regimen, multiple collaborative clinical trials have been developed that have resulted in important advances on the survival of patients with ALL, reaching overall survival rates up to 90% [6](#B6) ^,^ [7](#B7).\n\nDespite the improvements in the survival rate for most pediatric patients, relapses occur between 15% and 20% and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients with ALL [8](#B8) ^,^ [9](#B9). At the same time, in the majority of multicenter trials of first-line treatment for ALL in children, up to 5% die due to the treatment toxic side effects[10](#B10) ^,^ [11](#B11). Treatment-related deaths occur during recurrent and prolonged episodes of neutropenia and lymphopenia due to cytotoxic and immunosuppressive drugs or because leukemia itself could inhibit bone marrow recovery after induction therapy, especially in those patients classified as slow responders [10](#B10) ^,^ [12](#B12).\n\nTechnological progress has allowed the identification of genomic variations that determine characteristic pharmacogenomic patterns, responsible for the individual differences observed in response to treatment in terms of effectiveness or toxicity. Currently, the *TPMT* genotype is the main pharmacogenetic pattern with implications for treatment protocols for patients with ALL with treatment based on thiopurines [13](#B13). 6- mercaptopurine (6-MP) is specifically important in therapy maintenance, the longest phase during treatment. In patients with homozygous variants in *TPMT*, an 85%-90% dose reduction is required [14](#B14) ^-^ [17](#B17). Other genes involved in thiopurine metabolism have been evaluated for their behavior in ALL [15](#B15); Among these, the *NUDT15* gene has recently emerged as an important prediction candidate for toxicity [18](#B18).\n\nYang *et al*. [19](#B19), through a study of GWAS and its respective replication cohort, identified two loci related to the dose intensity of 6-MP: rs1142345 in the *TPMT* gene and rs116855232 in *NUDT15*. This last variant was common among Asians and Hispanics but infrequent among Europeans, and not observed in Africans, thus contributing to differences in mercaptopurine tolerance related to ancestry. Also, this study showed that heterozygous patients for *TPMT* or *NUDT15* variants required a 50% decrease in the 6-MP dose compared to those with wild type genotype [19](#B19). Based on these results, the same group of researchers, subsequently replicated these results in cohorts in Guatemala, Singapore, and Japan, adding functional genomics studies where they concluded that the presence of SNPs resulted in a loss of nucleotide diphosphatase activity, and patients with these defective *NUDT15* alleles exhibited high levels of active thiopurine metabolites, thus increasing their toxicity [20](#B20). Scientific interest in this gene has increased in recent years. It has led to its association with age related reductions in mercaptopurine dose[21](#B21), association with myelosuppression [22](#B22), development of severe toxicity [23](#B23), and 6-MP intolerance in specific population groups [24](#B24), making it an important candidate for evaluation in pharmacogenetic studies related to 6-MP tolerance, although with less support in the literature than the *TPMT*.\n\nTo date, there are no published reports of pharmacogenomic approaches to the treatment response and chemotherapy toxicity for ALL in the pediatric population of Colombia. This becomes even more important when pharmacogenetic differences related to ancestry have been described [25](#B25) ^-^ [28](#B28). It has been suggested that pharmacogenetic studies should be carried out independently or collaboratively in different Latin American countries to better understand these relationships [29](#B29). This study aimed to evaluate the association between the genetic profile of the *NUDT15* and *TPMT* genes and the side effects during maintenance phase of treatment in a sample of Colombian pediatric patients with acute lymphoid leukemia.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Design\n\nThis was an observational, longitudinal study carried out at a university-affiliated pediatric cancer center in Bogota, Colombia, that receives patients from rural and urban areas, and it is a national referral hospital for childhood cancer care.\n\n### Patients and data collection\n\nPatients from 1 to 18 years of age diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were admitted to the Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit and who were in the maintenance therapy of BFM ALLIC 2009 chemotherapy protocol during 2017 were enrolled in this study. Patients younger than 1-year-old or those with Down syndrome as comorbidity were excluded from this study. For this study, a convenience sampling was carried out, including consecutively all the patients who met the selection criteria and agreed to participate. The characteristics and clinical results obtained with this protocol in our setting have been previously published [30](#B30). The study was conducted in accordance with the national policy for clinical research and followed the Declaration of Helsinki Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects. This research protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the participating university and hospital. (Act 015-184-16 of 08/25/16 and CEI-38-16 of 08/11/16). Patients' blood samples and clinical data were collected after obtaining parental consent. Additionally, for each patient from 14 years of age, their assent to participate in this study was obtained.\n\nThe surplus of the whole blood sample taken as part of the usual controls was used for DNA extraction. In addition, patients were followed up monthly for six months in order to identify the occurrence of adverse effects due to treatment (myelosuppression, liver toxicity, or toxic death). During this follow-up, information regarding laboratory (white blood cell (WBC) count and liver function) and clinical data related to adjustments in treatment and the development of complications were collected. For this study, follow-up was carried out in conjunction with follow-up visits during maintenance, which for these patients are carried out on a monthly basis.\n\n### Outcomes\n\nThe outcomes of interest were side effects as myelotoxicity and liver toxicity and the dose reduction or interruption of 6-MP. As an exploratory analysis, we evaluated other outcomes as febrile neutropenia, relapse and deaths.\n\n### DNA extraction\n\nThe DNA extraction was carried out using the QIamp DNA Blood Mini Kit™, following the manufacturer's specifications and as previously reported [31](#B31) ^,^ [32](#B32). Briefly, 200 μL of whole blood was subjected to the series of steps described in the manufacturer's guide, using the technique of column filtration by microcentrifugation. The DNA quantification was carried out by spectrophotometry in a Nanodrop2000™, and this same equipment was used to measure the 260/280 nm ratio to determine the purity of the genetic material. The genetic material obtained was stored in 1.5 mL Eppendorf™ tubes at a temperature of -20° C until its use in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays.\n\n### TaqMan® 5' nuclease real-time PCR\n\nThe determination of the genotypes of the SNPs (rs1800462, rs1800460, rs1142345, and rs116855232) in the *TPMT* and *NUDT15* genes was carried out in real-time PCR for allelic discrimination by 5' nuclease using commercially available TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays (Assay ID: C__12091552_30, C__30634116_20, C_____19567_20 and C_154823200_10, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), following the recommendations described in the \"TaqMan® Allelic Discrimination Guide\". For this, we used a PCR mixture containing 15 ng DNA (3 μL), 1.25 μL of the corresponding TaqMan® probe (20X), 12.5 μL TaqMan® Gene Expression Master Mix and 8.25 μL of nuclease-free ultrapure water for a final volume per reaction of 25 μL. All the tests were carried out in duplicate. The tests were carried out using the CFX96 Touch ™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad), following the operating conditions suggested by the manufacturer for each probe.\n\n### Data analysis\n\nData are presented as median plus interquartile ranges for the quantitative variables, while their respective frequencies are shown for the qualitative data. The allelic and genotypic frequencies, as well as the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, were evaluated using snpReady. *TPMT* typing was carried out following the standards of the Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium [13](#B13). Briefly, *TPMT* haplotypes were determined based on the combinations of SNPs rs1800462, rs1800460 and rs1142345 as follows: CCT = * 1, GCT = * 2, CTC = * 3A, CTT = * 3B and CCC = * 3C. To determine the association between the genetic variants and the outcome of interest (some type of toxicity), the Chi-square statistic was used. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Mac, version 2.0, and a value of *p* <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n## Results\n\n### General characteristics of study subjects\n\nA total of 73 patients with ALL diagnosis that were in maintenance phase during 2017 in our institution. Of these, 70 patients agreed to participate in the project. From these patients, in two cases, it was not possible to extract DNA for genetic studies, so the statistical analyzes were based on the 68 patients in whom genetic studies were performed. [Figure 1](#f1) presents a flow diagram showing the selection of patients included in the analysis.\n\n### Figure 1. Patients' inclusion flowchart. This diagram shows how the inclusion of patients in the study was carried out and the details of the performance of the genetic studies.\n\n![Figure 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/10b8/8973308/11eec94693d6/1657-9534-cm-52-03-e2074569-gf1.jpg)\n\n[Table 1](#t2) summarizes the general characteristics of the study population. A total of 70 patients were included in the study, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1. The median age was six years when entering the maintenance therapy (IQR: 7 years). More than 50% of the study population was from Bogota, close to 42% were from small towns and rural areas. Regarding the outcomes evaluated, myelotoxicity in 25% Liver toxicity in 27% and reduction of 6-MP during follow-up was documented in 32.9% of patients. It is important to highlight that in our 6-month follow-up, there were no loss of patients.\n\n### Table 1.

For each laboratory data, the measurement system used has been noted. The data presented in the \"Measure\" columns corresponds to the n or medians (subcolumn n or median) and in the other subcolumn its percentage or interquartile range (IQR) is evidenced.\n\n### Allele and genotype frequencies\n\nOf the 70 patients included in the study, genetic material with adequate quality and quantity was obtained in 68 cases (concentrations from 10 to 129 ng/µL and an average 260/280nm ratio of 1.87; optimal values between 1.8 and 2.0- [33](#B33) ^,^ [34](#B34)). Although DNA extraction was carried out twice for the other two cases, no genetic material was obtained with the quality conditions required to carrying out the polymerase chain reaction assays. A total of 14 patients carried a susceptibility allele: 4 for *NUDT15*, 4 for rs1800462 (*TPMT*), 6 for rs1800460 (*TPMT*), and 4 for rs1142345 of *TPMT*. [Figure 2](#f2) shown representative allelic discrimination.\n\n### Figure 2. Representative allelic discrimination plots for TaqMan genotyping assays. There were no homozygous patients for the mutated alleles of any of the polymorphisms studied. The graphs represent the groups of samples with the wild type allele aligned towards the X or Y axes according to the probe used for their recognition. The non-aligned dots correspond to the mutated allele.\n\n![Figure 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/10b8/8973308/51da3339150e/1657-9534-cm-52-03-e2074569-gf2.jpg)\n\n[Table 2](#t3) shows the summary of allelic and genotype frequencies for each of the SNP's tested. All variants were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). [Table 3](#t4) summarizes the typing of *TPMT* following the standards of the Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium\" in the 42 patients in which the typing of the 3 SNPs was controlled [13](#B13). Briefly, *TPMT* haplotypes were determined based on the combinations of SNPs rs1800462, rs1800460 and rs1142345 as follows: CCT = * 1, GCT = * 2, CTC = * 3A, CTT = * 3B and CCC = * 3C.\n\n### Table 2. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of the polymorphisms of interest.\n\n| Gene |   | Annotation | n | Frequency | HWE (p Value) | LatinAmerica1 | LatinAmerica2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NUDT15 | Alleles | rs116855232 | 68 |   | 0.802 | n= 804 | n= 974 |\n| C | 132 | 0.97 | 0.994 | 0.953 |  |  |  |\n| T | 4 | 0.03 | 0.006 | 0.047 |  |  |  |\n| Genotypes | C/C | 64 | 0.94 |   |   |  |  |\n| C/T | 4 | 0.06 |   |   |  |  |  |\n| T/T | 0 | 0 |   |   |  |  |  |\n\nTable 2 Caption: This table shows the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the polymorphisms studied. All variants were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (column HWE). Additionally, the allelic frequencies identified in our study were compared with those reported in Latin American population noted in the ALFA project. There were no statistically significant differences between our frequencies and those reported in the ALFA project.\n\n### Table 3. TPMT typing.\n\n|   | Frequencies |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Haplotypes | *1 | 78 |\n| *2 | 2 |  |\n| *3A | 4 |  |\n| Types | *1/*1 | 36 |\n| *1/*2 | 2 |  |\n| *1/*3A | 4 |  |\n\nTable 3 Caption: Frequencies of TPMT haplotypes based on the standards of the \"Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium\" are listed. Given that genotyping of rs1142345 was only possible in 42 subjects and that to carry out these classifications, it is necessary to have genotyping of the 3 TPMT loci. These data correspond only to the 42 patients in whom genotyping was completed.\n\nThe allele frequencies obtained in the present study were compared to the frequencies reported in the dbSNP databases for Latin American populations obtained from the ALFA (Allele Frequency aggregator) ([Table 3](#t4)). The database frequency of genotypes and phenotypes (dbGap) was developed to archive and distribute the data and results from studies that have investigated the interaction of genotype and phenotype in humans [35](#B35). The results obtained for each SNP analyzed did not show a statistically significant difference from the frequencies obtained in the ALFA project.\n\n### Genetics associations\n\n[Table 4](#t5) summarizes the results of the bivariate analyzes in which the correlation between the genetic variants of the SNPs of interest in *NUDT15* and *TPMT* and the side effects of interest. No association was found between the outcomes of interest and the genetic variant of *NUDT15* or any *TPMT* polymorphisms evaluated individually. Similar analyses were carried out about the typing of *TPMT*, using the homozygosity variable for allele *1 versus carrying *2 or *3A as heterozygous, without evidence of any statistically significant association ([supplementary table 1S](#t7)).\n\n### Table 4.

No statistically significant association was found between any of the polymorphisms studied and the outcomes of interest.\n\nAlthough no statistically significant associations were identified, two of the four patients heterozygous for *NUDT15* required a decrease in 6-MP during the follow-up period. Concerning the genetic variants of *TPMT*, for rs1800462, two of the four heterozygous patients presented febrile neutropenia, and the same patients also required discontinuation 6-MP during the first six months of maintenance therapy. In the case of rs1800460, of the six heterozygous patients, three required a dosage decrease, and two were also heterozygous for rs1142345. Additionally, differences in the median for the lab values taken in the first 6 months of maintenance treatment were evaluated: aminotransferases, total bilirubin, leukocytes, and differential cell counts; based on genetic variants, no statistically significant differences were found ([Supplementary table 2S](#t6)).\n\n## Discussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study in Colombia that evaluated the the *NUDT15* and *TPMT* genes polymorphisms and their correlation with the side effects of chemotherapy in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although we are considered as a Latino population, different degrees of Caucasian, Amerindian and African ancestry are found in different regions of Colombia. Although, our findings vary significantly from previous reports regarding the association between variants and outcomes [16](#B16) ^,^ [19](#B19) ^,^ [36](#B36) ^,^ [37](#B37), those studies were carried out in non-Latino population.\n\nThe allelic frequency for the *NUDT15* mutation identified in our study (0.03) is lower than previously reported [19](#B19) ^,^ [36](#B36) ^,^ [38](#B38) ^,^ [39](#B39), a possible explanation for this finding is that most studies on this polymorphism were done in populations of Asian origin, finding allelic frequencies of up to 0.27. In the sample tested in our study, originated from the central Andean region of Colombia, the caucasian component (European ancestry) could account for near 50-60% of the genetic ancestry [40](#B40). Another reason could be related to our sample size [24](#B24) ^,^ [41](#B41). For the particular case of *TPMT* polymorphisms, only one study has previously been conducted in the Colombian population, in which Isaza *et al*. [42](#B42), describe frequencies for allele *2 and *3A of 0.004 and 0.035, respectively, which are lower than those found by us (0.02 and 0.05, respectively). When compared to other Latin American results, we found that our frequencies are also slightly different from those described by Garrido *et al*. [43](#B43), in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Guatemala. They identified a frequency of 0.005 for *2 and 0.0375 for *3A. However, our *2 frequency is similar to that found in Brazil by Boson *et al*. [44](#B44), who describe a frequency of 0.022 but a much lower frequency for *3A (0.015). More recently, in Uruguayan pediatric patients who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a *3A frequency of 0.05, which is similar to ours, has been described, but with a lower frequency of *2 [37](#B37).\n\nIncreasing evidence highlights the role of genetic variants of *NUDT15* in the development of side effects of 6-MP toxicity [19](#B19) ^,^ [20](#B20) ^,^ [36](#B36) ^,^ [37](#B37). However, when evaluating the possible associations in our study population, we failed to identify any statistical significance, possibly because of the sample size. Concerning *TPMT*, evidence supports its role in both the pharmacokinetics and the toxic effects of mercaptopurine [13](#B13) ^,^ [16](#B16). Our study did not find any association between the allelic frequencies of each polymorphism or in those 42 cases in which we had the complete typing of *TPMT*. Among the possible reasons that would explain this results, for the case of *NUDT15,* could be that the original studies describing such associations were based on GWAS approach [19](#B19), in which the representation of the Latino population was low, and this may be due to an effect related to the specific ancestry of the Colombian population [45](#B45). On the other hand, in the case of *TPMT*, an explanation could be that the alleles found in our population (*2 and *3A) correspond to intermediate metabolizers, which usually do not require many adjustments in therapy [13](#B13).\n\nIn exploratory analyses, we evaluated whether there was an association between the genetic variants studied and the outcomes: relapses or death, reviewed as of October 2018, without showing any correlation, which is consistent with what is described by Lennard *et al*. [46](#B46), who, after genotyping *TPMT* in 2,387 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, found no association with event-free survival. Within the limitations of the present study, there are the sample size and selection bias since it is a captive sample. However, patients were included prospectively and consecutively, which allowed better follow-up of the development of the adverse events of interest. On the other hand, a great strength of the present study is the translational approach, based on previous clinical observations and the evaluation of basic biomedical aspects that could answer the search for predictive factors for the development of toxicity in the treatment of pediatric patients with oncological conditions.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn summary, the allelic frequencies of the genes of interest were different from those previously described, even when compared with Latin American studies. We did not find any statistical association with toxicity events for any of the polymorphisms studied. These findings highlight the need for future studies with a larger sample size; either through a multicenter study with pediatric ALL patients or even including other pediatric populations receiving management with thiopurines, such as patients with inflammatory bowel disease or juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which may allow us to have an adecuate sample size on which to identify better inferences of associations with toxicity outcomes, as well as, to evaluate the possibility that other genes may be influencing toxicity and side effects and to examine the effect that ancestry could have on these interactions in populations with a genetic admixture like our population.\n\n## Acknowledgements:\n\nWe thank the patients and families who agreed to participate in this study, and the Genetics Institute of the National University of Colombia in Bogota for providing us their facilities to develop genotyping tests.

We characterized relationships between nevirapine-associated cutaneous and hepatic adverse events and genetic variants among HIV-infected adults.\n\n**Design:** \nWe retrospectively identified cases and controls. Cases experienced symptomatic nevirapine-associated severe (grade III/IV) cutaneous and/or hepatic adverse events within 8 weeks of initiating nevirapine. Controls did not experience adverse events during more than 18 weeks of nevirapine therapy.\n\n**Methods:** \nCases and controls were matched 1 : 2 on baseline CD4 T-cell count, sex, and race. Individuals with 150 or less CD4 T cells/μl at baseline were excluded. We characterized 123 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and 2744 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and drug metabolism and transport genes.\n\n**Results:** \nWe studied 276 evaluable cases (175 cutaneous adverse events, 101 hepatic adverse events) and 587 controls. Cutaneous adverse events were associated with CYP2B6 516G→T (OR 1.66, all), HLA-Cw*04 (OR 2.51, all), and HLA-B*35 (OR 3.47, Asians; 5.65, Thais). Risk for cutaneous adverse events was particularly high among Blacks with CYP2B6 516TT and HLA-Cw*04 (OR 18.90) and Asians with HLA-B*35 and HLA-Cw*04 (OR 18.34). Hepatic adverse events were associated with HLA-DRB*01 (OR 3.02, Whites), but not CYP2B6 genotypes. Associations differed by population, at least in part reflecting allele frequencies.\n\n**Conclusion:** \nAmong patients with at least 150 CD4 T cells/μl, polymorphisms in drug metabolism and immune response pathways were associated with greater likelihood of risk for nevirapine-related adverse events. Results suggest fundamentally different mechanisms of adverse events: cutaneous, most likely MHC class I-mediated, influenced by nevirapine CYP2B6 metabolism; hepatic, most likely MHC class II-mediated and unaffected by such metabolism. These risk variants are insensitive for routine clinical screening.\n\nKeywords: CYP2B6, HIV, human leukocyte antigen, nevirapine, pharmacogenomics, rash, toxicogenomics\n\n### Objective\n\nNevirapine is widely prescribed for HIV-1 infection.

Results suggest fundamentally different mechanisms of adverse events: cutaneous, most likely MHC class I-mediated, influenced by nevirapine CYP2B6 metabolism; hepatic, most likely MHC class II-mediated and unaffected by such metabolism. These risk variants are insensitive for routine clinical screening.\n\n## Introduction\n\nNevirapine is widely prescribed for type 1 HIV (HIV-1) infection. Although generally well tolerated and effective, some individuals who receive multiple doses of nevirapine experience severe cutaneous and/or hepatic adverse events during the initial weeks of therapy, especially when initiated at higher CD4 T-cell counts [[1](#R1)]. It is therefore recommended that nevirapine therapy not be initiated in antiretroviral-naive women and men with greater than 250 and 400 CD4 T cells/μl, respectively [[2](#R2)].\n\nHuman genetic variants may affect risk for nevirapine-associated adverse events, but results of prior genetic association studies have been inconsistent [[3](#R3)]. A study from Australia implicated *HLA-DRB1*0101* as a risk for hepatic adverse events [[4](#R4)], whereas studies from Sardinia and Japan implicated *HLA-Cw*08* [[5](#R5),[6](#R6)]. Studies from South Africa and Mozambique implicated a polymorphism in *ABCB1* (which encodes the multidrug efflux pump P-glycoprotein) with hepatic adverse events [[7](#R7),[8](#R8)] but not *CYP2B6* 516G→T [[7](#R7)], which is known to increase nevirapine plasma exposure [[9](#R9)–[15](#R15)]. Studies from Thailand implicated *HLA-Cw*0401* and *HLA-B*3505* as being associated with nevirapine-associated cutaneous adverse events [[16](#R16),[17](#R17)]. Such inconsistencies may reflect different adverse event phenotypes, patient ancestries, and/or genotyping strategies. False discovery is also possible even with seemingly well-designed studies [[18](#R18)].\n\nTo identify genetic variants associated with severe cutaneous rash and/or hepatic adverse events during the initial 8 weeks (the period of highest risk) of nevirapine-containing regimens we recruited cases and controls (matched on sex, race, and CD4 T-cell counts), and genotyped both human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes among cohorts of African, Asian, and European descent (hereafter referred to as Black, Asian, and White, respectively).\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n### Study population\n\nThis was a retrospective, case-controlled study with prospective DNA collection. Cases and controls were at least 18 years of age, HIV-1-infected, and had previously initiated nevirapine-containing therapy. Cases had experienced one or more of the following cutaneous or hepatic adverse events within the first 8 weeks of initiating nevirapine: severe cutaneous toxicity [grade III or IV categorized by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Division of AIDS criteria] [[19](#R19)]; symptomatic grade ≥3 hepatic transaminase elevation [alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >5× upper limit of normal (ULN)]; or acute hepatic failure.\n\nPotential cases and controls were excluded for: 150 or less CD4 T cells/μl at last available date within 6 months before initiating nevirapine; acute viral hepatitis; use of immunomodulatory medications within the first 8 weeks of nevirapine therapy; no hepatic transaminase data within 6 months prior to initiating nevirapine; or previous participation in the 2NN long-term follow-up study. Potential cases were also excluded for: hepatotoxicity or rash that the investigators judged unrelated to nevirapine; initiation of abacavir or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole within 2 weeks prior to or within 8 weeks after initiating nevirapine; and ALT or AST values greater than 5 × ULN (grade >3) prior to initiating nevirapine. Potential controls were excluded for: development of grade ≥ 1 rash within 18 weeks of initiating nevirapine or any cutaneous condition potentially attributable to nevirapine; ALT or AST values greater than 2.5× ULN within 18 weeks of starting nevirapine; any hepatobiliary adverse event possibly due to nevirapine; or any systemic reaction (e.g. flu-like symptoms, arthralgia, myalgia, or conjunctivitis) attributable to nevirapine during the first 18 weeks of treatment.\n\nCases and controls were matched 1:2, respectively, on CD4 T-cell count within 50 cells/μl, sex, and self-reported race. Site personnel were asked to enrol three potential matched controls per case. Final matching was done centrally. Controls that did not match were excluded. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each site, and all participants provided written informed consent. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ([NCT00310843](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00310843)).\n\n### Study design\n\nThe study involved a screening visit and a subsequent entry and blood sampling visit. A total of 1536 patients were enrolled, of whom 647 failed screening based on eligibility criteria or case-control matching requirements.\n\n### Genotyping\n\nGenomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using Invitrogen iPrep (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, California, USA). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assayed in drug absorption, disposition, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes (including 10-kb upstream and downstream regions), based on dbSNP version 128 and Genome NCBI build version 36 (SNP list available upon request). Some MHC-region SNPs were selected from Illumina MHC Mapping Panel and MHC Exon-Centric Panel (Illumina Inc., San Diego, California, USA). Assay was finalized based on primer designability and validation score. Genotyping was performed using Illumina BeadArray technology (Illumina Inc.): success rate 88.0–93.4% for SNPs, 99.4–100% for patient samples, reproducibility 100% between duplicates. We excluded participants with disagreement between sex indicated by genotype and clinical records.\n\n*HLA-A*, *HLA-B*, *HLA-C*, and *HLA-DPB*, *HLA-DQB*, and *HLA-DRB* typing of all samples was performed with LIFECODES HLA DNA typing kits using Luminex xMAP technology and a reverse SSO protocol (Tepnel Lifecodes Corporation, Stamford, Connecticut, USA). DNA amplification and hybridization conditions followed manufacturer's protocol.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nHLA alleles and SNPs were analyzed for association with adverse events in the total population and in each race group separately. Validity of self-reported race was supported by principal component analysis of SNP data with two principal components defining three clusters. Concordance with self-reported race was greater than 96%.\n\nFisher's exact test was used to analyze association of HLA alleles with adverse events in the three race groups and *P* values were corrected for multiple testing by dividing uncorrected *P* values by number of alleles with greater than 1% frequency. All alleles with homogeneous odds ratios (ORs) (Breslow-Day test *P* value >0.01) among the three race groups were tested for association with adverse events in the total population by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.\n\nAfter filtering SNPs with call rates below 80%, minor allele frequencies less than 1%, or for controls not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (*P* < 0.001), retained SNPs were tested for association with adverse events by allelic test, genotypic test, Cochran-Armitage trend test, and tests for dominant-effect and recessive-effect models, as implemented in PLINK (version 1.06) [[20](#R20),[21](#R21)]. All tests were adjusted for multiple testing. Linkage disequilibrium was based on *r*^2^ values.\n\nClinical variables were tested for association with adverse events by conditional logistic regression. HLA alleles and *CYP2B6* SNPs associated with cutaneous adverse events, clinical variables, and their two-way product terms were used as explanatory variables in multiple logistic regression models. For *CYP2B6* SNPs, an additive effect was assumed, with 0, 1, or 2 encoding the number of risk alleles. Forward and backward elimination were used to select variables associated with cutaneous adverse events.\n\n## Results\n\n### Patient characteristics\n\nThe study enrolled 889 participants from 2006 to 2008 at 76 sites in 11 countries (Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and US), including 276 evaluable cases (175 with cutaneous adverse events, 101 with hepatic adverse events) and 587 evaluable controls ([Fig. 1](#F1)). Self-reported race (Asian, African, or European descent and herein referred to as Asian, Black, or White) agreed with the SNP data. Among Asians, 74.3% were Thai and among Whites, 31% self-identified as Hispanic/Latino. Demographic variables and baseline characteristics are shown in [Table 1](#T1). Baseline CD4 T-cell counts were greater than 250 and 400 cells/ml in 69.7 and 48.7% of women and men, respectively; 71.8% of all participants had prior antiretroviral exposure. No demographic or clinical variable was significantly associated with adverse events.\n\n### Fig. 1.\n\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0c9c/3387531/c7e25f0bf397/nihms369845f1.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3387531_nihms369845f1.jpg)\n\nDisposition of study volunteers.

In analyses controlled for population stratification among all participants, two linked SNPs in *CYP2B6* [rs2054675 and rs3786547 (*r*^2^ = 0.982)] were significantly associated with cutaneous adverse events after correcting for multiple comparisons ([Fig. 2a](#F2)). Both were in linkage disequilibrium with rs3745274 (*CYP2B6* 516G→T; *r*^2^ > 0.90) ([Fig. 2b](#F2)), which is known to predict delayed plasma nevirapine clearance [[9](#R9)–[15](#R15)].\n\n### Fig. 2.\n\n![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0c9c/3387531/1abfefe99550/nihms369845f2.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3387531_nihms369845f2.jpg)\n\nAssociations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and adverse events. Panel (a) is a Manhattan plot of the results for cutaneous adverse events (AEs) compared with controls. Panel (b) shows CYP2B6 SNPs associated with cutaneous AEs. Panel (c) is a Manhattan plot of the results for hepatic AEs compared with controls. In panels (a) and (b), the −log10 P values were plotted against chromosome positions. Lines indicate a Bonferroni corrected P value of 0.05. Panel (a) represents 2336 SNPs. Panel (c) represents 2058 SNPs. The three SNPs labeled are in CYP2B6.\n\nFor *CYP2B6* 516G→T, increasing T-allele count (0, 1, 2) was significantly associated with progressively increased risk of cutaneous adverse events in Blacks and Whites, with a weak trend in Asians (*P*=0.0025, *P*=0.021, and *P*=0.12, respectively, Cochran-Armitage trend test). Among Asians, the association was stronger for rs2054675 and rs3786547 (both *P* = 0.041). The association with 516G→T was particularly strong in Blacks, in whom the OR for 516TT homozygosity relative to 516GG homozygosity was 5.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53–26.8]. No SNP was significantly associated with hepatic adverse events after correcting for multiple comparisons ([Fig. 2c](#F2)).\n\nThere were possible associations between cutaneous adverse events and MHC polymorphisms *(HLA-B, HLA-C*, *CCHCR1*, *TCF19*), although none withstood multiple comparisons ([Fig. 2a](#F2)). We found no statistically significant association between *ABCB1* 3435C→T and nevirapine-associated cutaneous or hepatic adverse events, although the OR for hepatic adverse events among Blacks was 0.50 (95% CI 0.14–1.76; *P*= 0.27).\n\n### Associations with HLA alleles\n\nA total of 863 patients were HLA typed. *HLA-Cw*04* was significantly associated with cutaneous adverse events among all study participants, most notably among Blacks and Asians ([Fig. 3a](#F3)). *HLA-B*35* was strongly associated with cutaneous adverse events in Asian and Thai participants, but not in non-Thai Asians (mainly Taiwanese); there was a weak association with *HLA-B*35* among Whites that did not withstand multiple testing correction. In analyses that excluded individuals with concomitant cutaneous and hepatic adverse events, OR for cutaneous adverse events increased from 5.65 to 7.31 for *HLA-B*35* in Thai participants and from 2.51 to 2.98 for *HLA-Cw*04* among all participants (data not shown). Among Asians, but not Blacks or Whites, the OR for cutaneous adverse events was markedly increased among those carrying both *HLA-Cw*04* and *HLA-B*35* (OR 18.34, 95% CI 5.10–65.99). Among Whites, a weak association between cutaneous adverse events and the relatively infrequent *HLA-Cw*15* was no longer apparent when considering patients with only isolated cutaneous adverse events.\n\n### Fig. 3.\n\n![Fig. 3](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0c9c/3387531/a8cac16531b1/nihms369845f3.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3387531_nihms369845f3.jpg)\n\nAssociations between HLA alleles and nevirapine-related adverse events. Panel (a) shows cutaneous adverse events (AEs). Panel (b) shows hepatic AEs. Odds ratios (OR) and two-tailed P value were calculated by Fisher's exact test in race groups for all HLA alleles, and by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH)test in the total population for HLA-Cw*04. All Thai participants were also included in the Asian group and were excluded from the CMH test. P values were corrected by Bonferroni procedure and corrected P value = Pvalue/n, where n is 22 for HLA-B*35, 13 for HLA-Cw*04, 13 for HLA-DRB1*01, and 286 for HLA-B35-Cw*04. Cases and controls are presented as numbers of participants (n) with the indicated genotypes divided by the numbers of cases or controls. Height of a square is proportional to the sample size. Horizontal lines represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n\n*HLA-DRB1*01* was significantly associated with hepatic adverse events in Whites ([Fig. 3b](#F3)). This HLA allele was infrequent among Blacks and rare among Asians. In analyses that excluded individuals with coincident cutaneous and hepatic adverse events, OR for hepatic adverse events among Whites increased from 3.02 to 3.63 for *HLA-DRB1*01.* Similarly, *HLA-DQB1*05* was significantly associated with hepatic adverse events among Whites only, despite its high frequency among Asians and Blacks but not when considering isolated hepatic adverse events (data not shown). We found no association between *HLA-Cw*08* (present in 7% of participants) and cutaneous or hepatic adverse events.\n\n### Associations with CYP2B6 and HLA combinations\n\nMajor associations with genetic polymorphism in *CYB2B6* and *HLA* are summarized in [Fig. 4a](#F4). Relationships between *HLA-Cw*04* and *CYP2B6* 516G→T and effects of clinical variables, including age, sex, CD4 T-cell count, race, plasma HIV-1 RNA, and antiretroviral history, were examined. By logistic regression analysis that adjusted for *HLA-Cw*04* and CYP2B6 516G→T, the only clinical variable associated with cutaneous adverse events was prior antiretroviral status (OR 0.57 for antiretroviral experienced, 95% CI 0.37–0.87; *P*= 0.0097; data not shown), particularly history of abacavir use in Whites (*P*= 0.010; data not shown), which was independent of *HLA-Cw*04* and *CYP2B6* 516G*→*T. History of use for stavudine were not associated with cutaneous or hepatic adverse events. Patients carrying both *CYP2B6* 516TT and *HLA-Cw*04* were at highest risk in the total population (OR 6.31, 95% CI 2.53–15.73), and in Blacks and Asians analyzed separately ([Fig. 4b](#F4)).\n\n### Fig. 4.\n\n![Fig. 4](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0c9c/3387531/c5388c31ccac/nihms369845f4.jpg)\n\n[View larger image](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=3387531_nihms369845f4.jpg)\n\nAssociation between polymorphisms and related adverse events. Panel (a) shows major association between genetic polymorphisms and nevirapine-related adverse events (AEs). CYP2B6 polymorphisms include rs2054675, rs3786547, and rs3745274. Panel (b) shows associations between CYP2B6 516G→T, HLA-Cw*04, and cutaneous AEs. The lowest risk genotype (CYP2B6 516GG and lacking HLA-Cw*04) was the reference for calculating odds ratios (OR) and two-tailed P values by Fisher's exact test for race groups and by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for total population. A continuity correction was made to calculate OR by adding one to all cells of a contingency table if a cell harbours zero. Cases and controls are presented as numbers of participants with the indicated genotypes divided by the numbers of cases or controls. Height of a square is proportional to sample size. Horizontal lines represent 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n\nAmong Asians, the three-way combination of *HLA-Cw*04, HLA-B*35,* and *CYP2B6* 516G→T was too infrequent to evaluate. Our matching of cases and controls on CD4 T-cell count prevented direct assessment of its relationship with adverse events. In post hoc analyses stratified by CD4 T-cell count, the latter did not contribute to adverse event risk in the presence of risk HLA alleles or SNPs.\n\n### Concomitant hepatic and cutaneous adverse events\n\nAmong the 276 evaluable cases, 74 were known to have had concomitant hepatic and cutaneous adverse events. We repeated the above analyses, limited to this subgroup of cases. After correcting for multiple comparisons, none of the above HLA alleles or SNP associations was significantly associated in this subgroup of cases, and no additional significant associations were identified (data not shown).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe present study characterizes associations between genetic variants and symptomatic hepatic and cutaneous reactions among HIV-1 patients who had initiated nevirapine with relatively high CD4 T-cell counts (>150 cells/μl). We convincingly demonstrated that polymorphisms in *CYP2B6* and multiple HLA loci were associated with a higher likelihood of risk for nevirapine-related adverse events. We also showed that genetic predictors of cutaneous versus hepatic adverse events differ, and that relationships between genetic variants and adverse events vary by race.\n\nThis is the first study that *CYP2B6* variants affect risk for nevirapine-associated adverse events. Major metabolic pathways for nevirapine involve hydroxylation by CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 [[22](#R22),[23](#R23)]. In addition, nevirapine induces CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 expression over several weeks, increasing its own clearance [[23](#R23)]. Previous studies associated *CYP2B6* 516G→T with increased plasma nevirapine concentrations [[9](#R9)–[15](#R15)], but separate analyses found no relationship between plasma nevirapine concentrations and adverse events [[24](#R24)]. It is possible that previous analyses missed a true association with plasma nevirapine concentrations. Alternatively, a metabolite, rather than parent compound, may mediate toxicity. With loss of *CYP2B6* function, more nevirapine may be shunted through pathways that generate minor metabolites. Consistent with this hypothesis, a rodent model implicated a quinine methide of nevirapine formed in the skin following sulfation of the 12-hydroxy metabolite [[25](#R25)]. Among 129 SNPs in 11 sulfotransferase and sulfatase genes assayed herein, none were significantly associated with adverse events. We found no association between *CYP2B6* variants and hepatic adverse events, consistent with limited previous data [[7](#R7),[8](#R8)] and with a rat model [[26](#R26)].\n\nCutaneous adverse events were associated with MHC class I alleles *(HLA-B*35* and *HLA-Cw*04)* and hepatic adverse events with MHC class II alleles *(HLA-DRB1*01* and possibly *HLA-DQB1*05*). These findings suggest distinct mechanisms with CD8 T cells (i.e. MHC class I) possibly more important for cutaneous adverse events, and CD4 T cells (i.e. MHC class II) more important for hepatic adverse events. The increased ORs observed when concomitant hepatitis and rash cases were excluded support this concept. Without more direct evidence, however, this hypothesis is tentative, as HLA associations do not prove causation. We suspect that associations with other polymorphisms in the MHC locus reflect linkage with risk HLA alleles.\n\nOur results support the association between *HLA-B*3505*, *HLA-Cw*0401*, and nevirapine-associated cutaneous adverse events previously reported among Thai populations [[16](#R16),[17](#R17)]. In analyses comprising 147 cases and 185 controls, Chantarangsu *et al.* [[17](#R17)] identified an association between *HLA-B*3505* and nevirapine-associated cutaneous adverse events (OR 18.96); also predictive were *HLA-Cw*0401* (OR 5.36) and the *HLA-Cw*0401-HLA-B*3501* haplotype (OR 12.12). Similarly, Likanonsakul *et al.* [[16](#R16)] reported an association between *HLA-Cw*04* and cutaneous adverse events among 39 cases and 60 controls. Our data confirmed strong associations between *HLA-B*35*, *HLA-Cw*04*, and cutaneous adverse events among Asians, particularly in Thai participants, and extended the *HLA-Cw*04* association to Black and White populations. The study results also showed that among *HLA-Cw*04* carriers, cutaneous adverse events were increased with concomitant *CYP2B6* 516G*→*T. In contrast, this study did not find significant associations with *HLA-B*35* in Blacks and Whites, perhaps reflecting its infrequency in these populations [[27](#R27)].\n\nThe results of our study also support the association between *HLA-DRB1*0101* and nevirapine-associated adverse events reported in the Western Australian HIV Cohort [[4](#R4)]. That study included 26 cases (25 Whites) who experienced ALT elevation, fever, and/or rash with nevirapine and 209 controls. *HLA-DRB1*0101* was significantly associated with hepatic/systemic reactions (OR 4.8), but not with isolated cutaneous adverse events. The association was only apparent in patients with at least 25% CD4 T cells [[4](#R4)]. The current study confirmed the association between *HLA-DRB1*01* and hepatic adverse events among Whites. We did not find any significant association with *HLA-DRB1*01* in Blacks and Asians, perhaps because *HLA-DRB1*01* is infrequent in these populations [[27](#R27)]. Results also indicated an association between *HLA-DQB*05* and hepatic adverse events in Whites, likely reflecting linkage between *HLA-DRB1*01* and *HLA-DQB1*05* [[27](#R27)]. However, among individuals with isolated hepatic adverse events the association with *HLA-DQB*05* was no longer significant, whereas the *HLA-DRB1*01* association increased.\n\nThis analysis did not replicate findings from studies in Sardinia and Japan that suggested an association between *HLA-Cw*08* and nevirapine-associated hypersensitivity [[5](#R5),[6](#R6)]. Two previous studies involving individuals of African descent suggested that *ABCB1* 3435C*→*T was associated with decreased nevirapine-associated hepatic adverse events [[5](#R5),[6](#R6)]. Whereas we found no statistically significant association between *ABCB1* 3435C*→*T and nevirapine-associated adverse events, the ORs for *ABCB1* 3435C*→*T and hepatic adverse events among Blacks was consistent with previous studies. There was no such association in Asians or Whites despite increased T-allele frequencies.\n\nOur study had limitations. Matching on CD4 T-cell count, sex, and race allowed more efficient discovery of genetic associations, but prevented assessment of these variables independently. Excluding individuals with mild or equivocal adverse events prevented us from assessing whether the same genetic variants predict less severe events. The retrospective design excluded individuals who died from any cause and limited the types of data we could reliably collect. The associations identified cannot be generalized to individuals with less than 150 CD4 T cells/μl, an exclusion criterion in our study. Although we performed extensive genotyping focused on ADME genes and MHC region, important HLA and non-HLA polymorphisms may have been missed. High-resolution HLA typing would likely increase ORs and specificities for at least some associations identified, but would likely not increase sensitivity.\n\nClinically useful markers for serious adverse events must be highly sensitive. Unfortunately, the genetic variants identified herein lacked sensitivity, and therefore have little or no clinical utility for patients initiating nevirapine-containing regimens. Among Asians with cutaneous adverse events, 80% were *HLA-B* 35*-negative; among all participants with cutaneous adverse events, 62% were *HLA-Cw* 04-neg*a*t*iv*e;* and among Whites with hepatic adverse events, 56% were *HLA-DRB1*01-negative.* Among all participants with any adverse event, 48% had neither an HLA risk allele (*HLA-Cw*04, -B*35, -DRB1*01*) nor homozygosity for *CYP2B6* 516TT This suggests additional, not yet identified risk factors. It is almost certain that some adverse events in the present study were unrelated to nevirapine, further limiting our ability to assess how effectively genetic testing would prevent true nevirapine reactions.\n\nNevirapine is generally well tolerated when initiated in patients who are treatment-naïve and have lower CD4 T-cell counts (<250 cells/μl in women, <400 cells/μl in men) [[2](#R2)]. These cut-offs may reduce nevirapine-related symptomatic hepatotoxicity to approximately 1% [[28](#R28)]. We show that both ADME and HLA variants affect risk for nevirapine-associated adverse events. These genetic variants, however, identified only a minority of adverse event cases. Continued search for additional genetic predictors is warranted, as are studies of underlying pathogenic mechanisms.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe work was sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
