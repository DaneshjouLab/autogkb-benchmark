                "We now report the results of fine recombinant genetic mapping in an expanded patient population of 248 consecutive, fully ascertained, abacavir-exposed individuals in the Western Australian HIV Cohort Study, in which 18 cases of definite abacavir hypersensitivity (7.3%) and 230 tolerant controls were identified. Haplotype mapping within patients with allelic markers of the 57.1 ancestral haplotype suggests a susceptibility locus within the 14-kb Hsp70 gene cluster. HLA-B*5701 was present in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases compared with 1.7% of controls (odds ratio, 960; P < 0.00001). A haplotypic nonsynonymous polymorphism of Hsp70-Hom (HspA1L, resulting from the substitution of residue M493T in the peptide-binding subunit) was found in combination with HLA-B*5701 in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases and 0.4% of controls (odds ratio, 3,893; P < 0.00001).",
                "The only nucleotide substitution in the Hsp70-Hom gene identified in most of the abacavir-hypersensitive cases (94.4%) involvedaTtoC transition, which results in a change from methionine to threonine at amino acid residue 493 [hereafter referred to as M493T but also known as the Hsp70-Hom 2437CT allele (19) or rs2227956CT (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?locusId=3305)]. The Hsp70-Hom M493T allele was assessed in all 248 patients of the cohort by using an allele-specific sequence-specific primer and/or the standard NcoI restriction fragment-length polymorphism assays. We observed that the Hsp70-Hom M493T allele, carried on the 57.1 AH, was detected in 94.4% of the hypersensitive group compared with 22.2% of tolerant controls (17 of 18 individuals vs. 51 of 230 individuals, OR = 59.7, Pc < 0.00001). However, in combination with HLA-B*5701, the Hsp70-Hom M493T allele was strongly associated with abacavir hypersensitivity (17 of 18 individuals vs. 1 of 230 individuals, OR = 3,893, Pc < 0.00001) (Table 2).",
                "In conclusion, we have identified the HLA-B*5701 and Hsp70-Hom M493T alleles as highly predictive genetic markers of susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity. These findings have significant implications both in terms of the clinical management of abacavir-exposed HIV-infected patients and the elucidation of basic pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this and other idiosyncratic drug hypersensitivity reactions."

                "We now report the results of fine recombinant genetic mapping in an expanded patient population of 248 consecutive, fully ascertained, abacavir-exposed individuals in the Western Australian HIV Cohort Study, in which 18 cases of definite abacavir hypersensitivity (7.3%) and 230 tolerant controls were identified. Haplotype mapping within patients with allelic markers of the 57.1 ancestral haplotype suggests a susceptibility locus within the 14-kb Hsp70 gene cluster. HLA-B*5701 was present in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases compared with 1.7% of controls (odds ratio, 960; P < 0.00001). A haplotypic nonsynonymous polymorphism of Hsp70-Hom (HspA1L, resulting from the substitution of residue M493T in the peptide-binding subunit) was found in combination with HLA-B*5701 in 94.4% of hypersensitive cases and 0.4% of controls (odds ratio, 3,893; P < 0.00001).",
                "The only nucleotide substitution in the Hsp70-Hom gene identified in most of the abacavir-hypersensitive cases (94.4%) involvedaTtoC transition, which results in a change from methionine to threonine at amino acid residue 493 [hereafter referred to as M493T but also known as the Hsp70-Hom 2437CT allele (19) or rs2227956CT (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?locusId=3305)]. The Hsp70-Hom M493T allele was assessed in all 248 patients of the cohort by using an allele-specific sequence-specific primer and/or the standard NcoI restriction fragment-length polymorphism assays. We observed that the Hsp70-Hom M493T allele, carried on the 57.1 AH, was detected in 94.4% of the hypersensitive group compared with 22.2% of tolerant controls (17 of 18 individuals vs. 51 of 230 individuals, OR = 59.7, Pc < 0.00001). However, in combination with HLA-B*5701, the Hsp70-Hom M493T allele was strongly associated with abacavir hypersensitivity (17 of 18 individuals vs. 1 of 230 individuals, OR = 3,893, Pc < 0.00001) (Table 2).",
                "In conclusion, we have identified the HLA-B*5701 and Hsp70-Hom M493T alleles as highly predictive genetic markers of susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity. These findings have significant implications both in terms of the clinical management of abacavir-exposed HIV-infected patients and the elucidation of basic pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this and other idiosyncratic drug hypersensitivity reactions."
