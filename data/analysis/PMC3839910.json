                "\u201cGiven the differences in origin between CBZ cases and controls, we performed a subgroup analysis for HLA-A*31:01 in patients with three or more grandparents of European origin. Twenty CBZ cases and 65 controls were included in this analysis. The frequency of HLA-A*31:01 in European CBZ-tolerant children (3.1%; [Table 3](#T3)) was similar to the frequency reported previously in a European study (3.9%). Similar results were observed for the association of HLA-A*31:01 with CBZ hypersensitivity as for the full cohort, with 20% of CBZ cases carrying HLA-A*31:01 (OR: 7.62; P=0.025; [Table 3](#T3)). As in the full cohort, a stronger association was observed when only considering patients with CBZ-HSS or MPE (OR: 10.05; P=0.013; [Table 3](#T3)).\u201d",
                "\u201cHLA-A*31:01 was significantly associated with CBZ-HSS (odds ratio (OR): 26.4, p=0.0025) and maculopapular exanthems (OR: 8.6, p=0.0037), but not with CBZ-SJS.\u201d",
                "\u201cThree of six patients (50%) with CBZ-HSS carried HLA-A*31:01, whereas only three (3.3%) of the 91 CBZ-tolerant controls carried the allele, resulting in a very strong association with CBZ-HSS (OR: 26.4; P=0.0025; [Table 2](#T2)). A significant association was also observed with CBZ-induced MPE, with six of 26 (23.1%) CBZ-MPE cases carrying HLA-A*31:01 (OR: 8.6; P=0.0037; [Table 2](#T2)). HLA-A*31:01 was thus very strongly associated with CBZ-HSS or MPE in a combined analysis of the two reactions (OR: 11.2; P=2.6\u00d710^\u22124^; [Table 2](#T2)), with nine (28.1%) of the cases carrying HLA-A*31:01.\u201d"
