The estimated kinetic parameters Vmax, Km and CLint for AR-C124910XX of CYP3A4*1 were 1743.33 pmol/min/nmol, 2.18 \u00b5M and 800.45 \u00b5L/min/nmol, respectively. Almost of the variants exhibited changed Vmax or Km values compared with that of CYP3A4*1, which results in significant variations in CLint.",
                "Except for CYP3A4*30, the remaining 21 CYP3A4 variants could be classified into the following three categories according to the relative clearance values compare with CYP3A4*1: CYP3A4*11, CYP3A4*18 and CYP3A4*33 showed significantly higher intrinsic clearance than that of CYP3A4*1; four CYP3A4 variants (CYP3A4*10, CYP3A4*23, CYP3A4*32 and CYP3A4*34) were not significantly different from that of wild-type; the remaining fourteen variants (CYP3A4*2-*5, *9, *14-*17, *19, *24, *28, *29, and *31,) exhibited significantly reduced CLint in different degrees (1.48%\u201375.11% relative clearance) compared to that of wild-type.",
                "In this study, insect cells were used to express 22 CYP3A4 variants, which were then incubated with 1\u201350 \u00b5M ticagrelor at 37 \u00b0C for 30 minutes to obtain the metabolite (AR-C124910XX). AR-C124910XX was detected by UHPLC-MS/MS to calculate the kinetic parameters, including Km, Vmax and CLint."
